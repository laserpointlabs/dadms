# DADM Release Notes - Version 0.10.0
*Released: June 18, 2025*

## üöÄ Major Features

### Enhanced DADM Dashboard
A complete overhaul of the system monitoring and control capabilities, providing a comprehensive web-based interface for managing the entire DADM ecosystem.

#### Live System Monitoring
- **Real-time Service Status**: Monitor backend API server, analysis daemon, and all Docker containers
- **System Resource Tracking**: Live memory usage, CPU load, and system performance metrics
- **Container Health Monitoring**: Health status for all 9 infrastructure containers (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Camunda, Qdrant, etc.)
- **PM2 Process Management**: Integration with PM2 for advanced process monitoring and control

#### Service Control Interface
- **Start/Stop/Restart Controls**: Direct control over backend services and analysis daemon
- **PM2 Integration**: Leverage PM2's robust process management capabilities
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Improved daemon stop logic with process detection and force kill fallback
- **Auto-recovery**: Automatic service restart capabilities for enhanced reliability

### Analysis Data Viewer
A sophisticated interface for visualizing and managing analysis results with deep integration into the DADM ecosystem.

#### Process Definition Integration
- **Camunda REST API Integration**: Direct connection to Camunda for process definition lookup
- **Historical Process Support**: Support for both active and completed process instances
- **Process Name Resolution**: Automatic conversion from process instance IDs to human-readable names
- **Version Display**: Show process definition versions alongside names

#### Data Visualization
- **Real-time Analysis Results**: Live display of analysis data from DADM CLI integration
- **Structured Data Presentation**: Transform flat API responses into intuitive nested displays
- **Process Grouping**: Group analyses by process instance for better organization
- **Interactive Controls**: View, export, and delete functionality for analysis records

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Backend API Server Enhancements
- **Robust Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout the analysis data pipeline
- **Function Scope Resolution**: Fixed critical ReferenceError issues preventing data retrieval
- **Enhanced Parsing Logic**: Better parsing of DADM CLI output with fallback mechanisms
- **System Status Endpoints**: Comprehensive API endpoints for system monitoring

### Frontend Data Management
- **Optimized Data Flow**: Streamlined data transformation from API to UI components
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript interfaces for better data structure definition
- **Error Resilience**: Improved fallback handling for missing or malformed data
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced unnecessary re-renders and API calls

### Camunda Integration
- **Dual API Support**: Integration with both active process instances and history APIs
- **Automatic Fallback**: Graceful handling when process instances are not found in active state
- **Data Enrichment**: Automatic enhancement of analysis data with process definition details
- **Connection Resilience**: Robust error handling for Camunda API connectivity issues

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Analysis Display Issues
- **"Unknown Process" Resolution**: Fixed the primary issue where analysis results showed generic labels instead of actual process names
- **Process Instance Lookup**: Corrected the mapping between analysis process IDs and Camunda process instances
- **Data Transformation**: Fixed frontend data mapping to properly utilize enriched process definition data
- **Version Display**: Resolved missing process version information in the UI

### System Management
- **Daemon Control Reliability**: Enhanced process detection and control for the analysis daemon
- **Service Status Accuracy**: Improved accuracy of service status reporting
- **PM2 Integration Stability**: Better integration with PM2 for consistent service management
- **Docker Container Monitoring**: Fixed container status detection and health reporting

## üìã API Changes

### New Endpoints
```
GET    /api/system/status        - Comprehensive system status
POST   /api/system/backend/:action    - Backend service control
POST   /api/system/daemon/:action     - Analysis daemon control
GET    /api/system/docker        - Docker container status
```

### Enhanced Endpoints
- **`/api/analysis/list`**: Now includes enriched process definition data
- **`/api/analysis/:id`**: Individual analysis records include process information

### Data Structure Changes
Analysis records now include:
```json
{
  "analysis_id": "...",
  "process_definition": {
    "name": "OpenAI Decision Tester",
    "version": 1,
    "key": "OpenAI_Decision_Tester",
    "deploymentId": "..."
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### For Existing Installations
1. **No Database Changes**: This release requires no database migrations
2. **Configuration Updates**: No configuration file changes needed
3. **Service Restart**: Restart backend services to pick up new functionality
4. **Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache to load updated frontend components

### Compatibility
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing APIs remain functional
- **Docker Images**: Update to latest images for full functionality
- **Camunda Integration**: Requires accessible Camunda REST API (typically port 8080)

## üéØ Use Cases

### System Administrators
- Monitor entire DADM ecosystem from single dashboard
- Quickly identify and resolve service issues
- Control services without direct server access
- Track system resource usage and performance

### Business Analysts
- View analysis results with meaningful process names
- Understand which business processes generated specific analyses
- Track analysis progress across different process definitions
- Export analysis data for reporting purposes

### Developers
- Debug process instances with clear process definition mapping
- Monitor service health during development
- Test process deployments with immediate feedback
- Troubleshoot integration issues through comprehensive logging

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Accessing the Dashboard
1. Start the DADM system: `cd ui && npm run backend:start`
2. Open browser to: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Navigate to Analysis Viewer: `http://localhost:3000/analysis`

### System Monitoring
- Access real-time system status via the dashboard
- Monitor all services including Docker containers
- Use start/stop controls for service management

### Viewing Analysis Results
