# Decision Matrix Template

## Evaluation Criteria

Each UAS platform should be evaluated using the following criteria, with weights assigned based on their importance to the mission:

| Criterion | Weight (1-10) | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Operational Range | 8 | Maximum distance the UAS can travel from the operator |
| Endurance | 9 | Flight time on a single fuel load or battery charge |
| Payload Capacity | 7 | Maximum weight of sensors and equipment that can be carried |
| Environmental Tolerance | 8 | Ability to operate in adverse weather conditions |
| Deployment Speed | 9 | Time required from arrival on scene to airborne operation |
| Image Quality | 7 | Resolution and clarity of imagery produced |
| Data Transmission | 6 | Range and security of data links |
| Cost | 5 | Total acquisition cost within budget constraints |
| Regulatory Compliance | 10 | Adherence to FAA/EASA and other regulatory requirements |
| Ease of Operation | 6 | Training requirements and interface usability |

## Scoring System

Each criterion should be scored on a 1-5 scale where:

1. Does not meet minimum requirements
2. Partially meets requirements with significant compromises
3. Meets basic requirements
4. Exceeds requirements
5. Far exceeds requirements, providing additional capabilities

## Calculation Method

1. Assign a raw score (1-5) for each criterion for each alternative
2. Multiply each raw score by the criterion weight
3. Sum the weighted scores for each alternative
4. Normalize results on a 0-100 scale for easy comparison

## Example Matrix Structure

| Criterion | Weight | Alternative A | Alternative B | Alternative C |
|-----------|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| | | Raw (Weighted) | Raw (Weighted) | Raw (Weighted) |
| Criterion 1 | W1 | R1A (W1×R1A) | R1B (W1×R1B) | R1C (W1×R1C) |
| Criterion 2 | W2 | R2A (W2×R2A) | R2B (W2×R2B) | R2C (W2×R2C) |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Criterion n | Wn | RnA (Wn×RnA) | RnB (Wn×RnB) | RnC (Wn×RnC) |
| **TOTAL** | | **Sum A** | **Sum B** | **Sum C** |
| **Normalized (0-100)** | | **Norm A** | **Norm B** | **Norm C** |

## Sensitivity Analysis

For the final recommendation, a sensitivity analysis should be conducted by:

1. Adjusting weights of critical criteria up/down by 20%
2. Evaluating if changes in weights alter the ranking of alternatives
3. Identifying if any alternatives are particularly sensitive to specific criteria

This helps ensure that the recommended solution is robust against slight changes in prioritization or requirements interpretation.
