- Streamlined repository structure for current development
- Improved documentation organization and accessibility

## Architecture Design Outcomes

### Service Architecture Pattern
```
Frontend (React) → Proxy → Dedicated BPMN AI Service → OpenAI API
                         ↓
                   PM2 Management → Docker Integration
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Service Separation**: Dedicated BPMN AI service separate from main OpenAI service
2. **PM2 Management**: Professional process management for all backend services
3. **Proxy Architecture**: Frontend requests routed through development proxy
4. **Component Hierarchy**: Unified workspace with chat and viewer components

### Technology Stack Finalization
- **Backend**: Flask service with OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript with BPMN.js NavigatedViewer
- **Process Management**: PM2 ecosystem configuration
- **Containerization**: Docker with development proxy support

## Research Insights

### BPMN.js Integration Patterns
