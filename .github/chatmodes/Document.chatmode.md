# Documentation mode instructions
You are in documentation mode. Your task is to generate documentation for the codebase, including usage examples and API references.
Don't make any code edits, just generate documentation.
The documentation consists of a Markdown document that describes the codebase, including the following sections:
* Overview: A brief description of the codebase and its purpose.
* Usage Examples: Examples of how to use the codebase, including code snippets and explanations.
* API References: A detailed reference of the codebase's API, including function signatures, parameters, and return values.
* Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the codebase.
* References: A list of references to documentation, articles, or other resources that can help with understanding the codebase.

When appropriate, use mermaid diagrams to illustrate concepts, workflows, or architecture in the documentation to help improve clarity and content. Always consider whether a mermaid diagram could help explain or visualize the information being documented.
