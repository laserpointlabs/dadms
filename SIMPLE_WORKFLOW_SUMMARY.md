# Simple OpenAI Service Base and Adder Workflow

## Summary

Successfully created a simplified OpenAI service and a basic BPMN workflow that demonstrates the LLM â†’ Analysis pipeline.

## What We Built

### 1. OpenAI Service Base (`/services/openai_service_base/`)
- **Simplified Configuration**: Removed complex decision analysis instructions
- **Basic Assistant**: Simple, focused OpenAI assistant without data files
- **Clean Instructions**: Minimal, clear instructions for basic task processing
- **Port 5001**: Runs on a different port to avoid conflicts
- **Service Name**: `dadm-openai-assistant-base`

### 2. Simple Adder Process (`/camunda_models/simple_adder_process.bpmn`)
- **Two-Step Workflow**:
  1. **Format Numbers for Addition** (LLM Service Task)
     - Uses the basic OpenAI assistant
     - Extracts/formats numbers into JSON structure
     - Outputs: `{"analysis_template": "adder", "item1": 10, "item2": 20}`
  
  2. **Add Numbers** (Analysis Service Task)
     - Uses the script registry service (port 8004)
     - Executes the adder script
     - Returns structured calculation results

### 3. Working Integration
- **LLM Formatting**: Basic assistant formats input data correctly
- **Analysis Execution**: Script registry executes adder successfully
- **Data Flow**: Properly structured JSON passes between steps
- **Service Routing**: BPMN service properties correctly route to services

## Test Results

```
ðŸ”„ DEMONSTRATING SIMPLE ADDER WORKFLOW
Process: Simple_Adder_Process
Steps:
  1. Format Numbers for Addition (Basic LLM)
  2. Add Numbers (Analysis Service)

LLM formatted output:
{
  "analysis_template": "adder",
  "item1": 10,
  "item2": 20
}

Analysis result:
âœ… Addition completed successfully!
Numbers: 10 + 20
Result: 30
Execution time: 0.000 seconds
```

## Service Architecture

```
BPMN Process (simple_adder_process.bpmn)
â”œâ”€â”€ FormatNumbersTask
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service.type: assistant
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service.name: dadm-openai-assistant-base
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ port: 5001
â””â”€â”€ AddNumbersTask
    â”œâ”€â”€ service.type: analysis
    â”œâ”€â”€ service.name: dadm-analysis-service
    â”œâ”€â”€ analysis.script_id: adder
    â””â”€â”€ port: 8004
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Simplified**: No complex data files or decision analysis complexity
2. **Modular**: Clear separation between LLM formatting and computation
3. **Testable**: Easy to test each component independently
4. **Extensible**: Foundation for adding more complex analysis scripts
5. **Clean Integration**: Shows the pattern for LLM â†’ Analysis workflows

## Next Steps

This basic workflow demonstrates the pattern for:
- More complex analysis scripts (sensitivity analysis, optimization, etc.)
- Multiple LLM formatting steps
- Chained analysis operations
- Integration with real BPMN processes

The simplified service can now be used as a foundation for building more sophisticated decision analysis workflows without the overhead of the complex original service.
