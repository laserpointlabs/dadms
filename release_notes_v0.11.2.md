## üìã Migration Guide

### From v0.11.1 to v0.11.2

This is a **backward-compatible patch release** with no breaking changes.

#### Automatic Updates
- No configuration changes required
- No database migrations needed
- Existing functionality remains unchanged
- New features are additive only

#### New Dependencies
The following dependencies are automatically managed:
- `bpmn-js` (loaded via CDN)
- `http-proxy-middleware` (for enhanced proxy configuration)

#### For Developers
If you're working on the DADM codebase:

1. **Pull Latest Changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Rebuild Docker Containers** (recommended):
   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **Clear Node Modules** (if experiencing issues):
   ```bash
   cd ui
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

#### For System Administrators
- **No action required** for existing deployments
- New BPMN viewer feature will be automatically available
- Monitor Docker logs during first startup to verify dependency loading

## üîç Verification Steps

After upgrading to v0.11.2, verify the new functionality:

1. **Access Process Management**: Navigate to the Process Management page in DADM UI
2. **Locate Schema Button**: Look for blue "Schema" buttons on process definition cards
3. **Open BPMN Viewer**: Click any "Schema" button to open the BPMN diagram viewer
4. **Test Interaction**: Verify you can zoom, pan, and interact with the diagram
5. **Check Multiple Processes**: Test with different process definitions to ensure reliability

## üö® Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- **Internet Dependency**: BPMN viewer requires internet access to load bpmn-js from CDN
- **Large Diagrams**: Very complex diagrams may take a moment to render initially
- **Browser Compatibility**: Best experience in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Upcoming Improvements
- **Offline Support**: Planning to bundle bpmn-js locally for offline environments
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching strategies for frequently accessed diagrams
- **Enhanced Interaction**: Additional diagram interaction features and export capabilities

## üéØ What's Next

### Planned for v0.11.3
- **Diagram Export**: Export BPMN diagrams to PNG, SVG, and PDF formats
- **Process Overlays**: Show execution data overlaid on process diagrams
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Improved zoom controls and diagram navigation tools

### Feedback Welcome
We're excited to hear your feedback on the new BPMN viewer! Please report any issues or suggestions through:
- GitHub Issues for technical problems
- User feedback channels for experience improvements
- Documentation updates for clarity enhancements

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues with this release:

1. **Check the Documentation**: Review `/docs/BPMN_VIEWER_IMPLEMENTATION_SOLUTION.md` for detailed troubleshooting
2. **Verify Environment**: Ensure Docker containers are running and have internet access
3. **Review Logs**: Check browser console and Docker logs for error messages
