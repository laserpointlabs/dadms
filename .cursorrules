# DADMS 2.0 Clean Development Context

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Branch Protection
**NEVER work directly on main branch for significant changes!**
Always create a feature branch first:
```bash
# Use our helper script:
./scripts/dev/create-branch.sh feature description-of-work
./scripts/dev/create-branch.sh fix issue-description
./scripts/dev/create-branch.sh infra infrastructure-change

# Or manually:
git checkout -b feature/description-of-work
```

# DADMS 2.0 Clean Development Context

## Project Overview
Building DADMS (Decision Analysis and Decision Management System) 2.0 from clean architecture.
This is a complete rewrite leveraging existing knowledge but starting with fresh, production-ready code.

## Architecture
- **Microservices**: Clean service-oriented architecture
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (primary), Neo4j (graph), Qdrant (vector)
- **UI**: Modern React with TypeScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers with proper orchestration

## Development Approach
- **Clean slate**: No legacy code dependencies
- **Best practices**: Industry-standard patterns and tools
- **MVP focus**: Core decision intelligence capabilities first
- **Documentation-driven**: Clear specifications guide implementation

## Week 1 Goals
1. **Project Service**: Clean user/project management
2. **Knowledge Service**: Document upload and RAG search
3. **LLM Service**: Multi-provider with tool calling
4. **UI Foundation**: Project dashboard and navigation
5. **Integration**: End-to-end workflow testing

## Key Principles
- Clean architecture with clear boundaries
- Comprehensive testing at all levels
- API-first design with OpenAPI specs
- Cloud-native deployment patterns
- Security and governance built-in

## Success Metrics
- Project creation < 30 seconds
- Document search < 5 seconds
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Full API documentation
- Comprehensive test coverage
