## Development Status
🚀 **Current Phase**: Week 1 Foundation Development
- ✅ Clean slate workspace with essential context restored
- ✅ MVP specification and implementation plan available
- ✅ Week 1 Day-by-day development guide ready
- 🔄 Ready to begin Day 1: Project Service implementation

## Getting Started
This is a clean rebuild - no legacy dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 15+

### Quick Start
```bash
# This will be implemented as services are built
npm run dev        # Start development environment
npm test          # Run test suite
npm run build     # Build for production
```

## Architecture Principles
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **API-First**: OpenAPI specifications drive implementation
- **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Cloud-Native**: Container-ready deployment
- **Security-First**: Authentication and authorization built-in

## Week 1 Implementation Plan
- [x] Clean branch and project structure
- [x] Restore essential context and specifications
- [ ] Day 1: User/Project Service foundation
- [ ] Day 2: Knowledge Service with RAG
- [ ] Day 3: LLM Service with tool calling
- [ ] Day 4: UI foundation and integration
- [ ] Day 5: Testing and documentation

## Available Specifications
- **DADMS_MVP_SPECIFICATION.md**: Complete MVP architecture and service definitions
- **DADMS_DEMONSTRATOR_SPECIFICATION.md**: Full system specification with 15 core services
- **DADMS_WEEK1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Detailed day-by-day implementation guide
- **DADMS_CONTEXT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md**: Context preservation and AI tool integration

## Contributing
This is a clean rebuild following modern development practices:
- Feature branch workflow
- Comprehensive testing required
- API documentation mandatory
