# DADM Release Notes v0.12.1

**Release Date:** June 21, 2025  
**Version:** 0.12.1  
**Previous Version:** 0.12.0

## üéØ Release Overview

DADM v0.12.1 focuses on enhancing the BPMN properties panel with professional-grade user experience improvements. This release introduces context-aware property display, real-time validation, and optimized save operations to provide a more efficient and user-friendly BPMN modeling environment.

## ‚ú® What's New

### üé® Enhanced BPMN Properties Panel
- **Context-Aware Property Display**: Properties panel now intelligently shows only relevant properties for each BPMN element type
- **Service Task-Specific Properties**: Implementation properties (Type, Topic) and Extension Properties (Service Type, Service Name, Service Version) only appear when editing service tasks
- **Element Type Detection**: Smart helper functions detect service tasks and processes to provide appropriate property sets
- **Professional UI Design**: Enhanced styling with smooth animations and visual feedback

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Validation System
- **Field-Specific Validation**: Comprehensive validation rules for all input fields with immediate feedback
- **Validation Rules**:
  - **Name**: Required, maximum 100 characters
  - **ID**: Required, must start with letter, only letters/numbers/underscores allowed
  - **Topic**: Must start with letter, only letters/numbers/hyphens/underscores allowed
  - **Service Name**: Must start with letter, only letters/numbers/hyphens/underscores allowed
  - **Service Version**: Must be in format X.Y or X.Y.Z
- **Visual Error Indicators**: Invalid fields show red borders and error messages
- **Error Prevention**: Properties with validation errors are not saved

### ‚ö° Optimized Save Operations
- **Debounced Saving**: 300ms debounce prevents excessive save operations while maintaining responsiveness
- **Save Status Indicators**: Visual feedback showing editing, saving, saved, and error states
- **Automatic XML Updates**: Triggers XML generation when properties are saved
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

### üé≠ Enhanced User Experience
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for editing, saving, saved, and error states
