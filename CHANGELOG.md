## [2.0.0-alpha.1] - Previous Release
### Added
- Initial DADMS 2.0 foundation with clean architecture
- Added `decision_context` field to the project model for richer project metadata and context-aware decision analysis.
- Updated database schema (`projects` table) to include `decision_context` column.
- Updated backend TypeScript types, service, controller, and validation logic to support the new field.
- Updated frontend types, project creation form, and project card display to include and show the `decision_context` field.
- Ensured OpenAPI/Swagger documentation and API responses include the new field.
- Added demo project with populated `decision_context` for end-to-end testing and UI visibility.

### Fixed
- Documented and resolved shell/SQL quoting issues for JSONB fields during demo data insertion by using SQL files and Podman commands.
