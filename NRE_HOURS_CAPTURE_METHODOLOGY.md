## Estimation Methodology

### 1. Historical Data Analysis
**Approach**: Use previous similar projects as baseline
- Identify comparable projects and features
- Adjust for complexity and scope differences
- Factor in team experience and technology familiarity
- Apply lessons learned and efficiency improvements

### 2. Bottom-Up Estimation
**Approach**: Break down work into smallest measurable units
- Decompose features into individual tasks
- Estimate each task independently
- Sum individual estimates for category totals
- Add contingency buffer (10-20%) for unknowns

### 3. Top-Down Estimation
**Approach**: Start with overall project estimate and allocate
- Estimate total project effort
- Apply standard category percentages
- Adjust based on project characteristics
- Validate against bottom-up estimates

### 4. Three-Point Estimation
**Approach**: Use optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates
- **Optimistic (O)**: Best-case scenario with no major issues
- **Pessimistic (P)**: Worst-case scenario with significant challenges
- **Most Likely (M)**: Realistic scenario with normal challenges
- **Formula**: (O + 4M + P) / 6
