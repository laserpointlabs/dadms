# DADMS 2.0 Integration Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step integration strategy for DADMS 2.0, implementing a BPMN-first orchestration approach with a centralized API Gateway. The goal is to build a flexible, extensible system where all capabilities are implemented as configurable workflows.

## Integration Strategy Overview

### Core Principles
1. **BPMN-First**: All capabilities (RAG, LLM, data processing) are BPMN workflows
2. **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all external integrations
3. **Event-Driven**: Real-time communication through EventManager
4. **Service Independence**: Services communicate through well-defined interfaces
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally
6. **AI-Native with DAS**: Digital Assistance System as the intelligent medium that permeates and evolves the platform

### Architecture Benefits
- **Flexibility**: Workflows can be modified without code changes
- **Observability**: Full process tracking and monitoring
- **Extensibility**: New capabilities as new workflow templates
- **Integration**: External tools can easily consume DADMS capabilities
- **Governance**: Approval workflows and process controls
