# Capability Assessment Framework
**Date**: July 7, 2025  
**Project**: Decision Analysis and Decision Management (DADM) Platform

## Executive Summary

The DADM Capability Assessment Framework provides a comprehensive methodology for measuring, tracking, and improving decision-making performance across all system components. Using a "batting average" approach, the framework continuously evaluates the effectiveness of processes, AI agents, and human decision-makers to drive systematic improvement.

## Batting Average Methodology

### Core Concept

The "batting average" approach borrows from baseball statistics to create an intuitive, comparable metric for decision-making performance. Unlike complex multi-factor scoring systems, batting averages provide clear, actionable insights into capability effectiveness.
