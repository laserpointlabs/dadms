# Test Deletion Issue Resolution
## July 11, 2025 - Pre-Session Fix

## 🔍 **Issue Identification**

### **User Report**
User noticed that after clearing test results and attempting to rerun tests, the UI would display "unknown error" messages and become unstable.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
The issue was caused by **foreign key relationship problems** in the database schema:

1. **Database Schema Structure**:
   ```sql
   test_results.test_case_id → test_cases.id  (FOREIGN KEY)
   test_results.prompt_id, prompt_version → prompts.id, version  (FOREIGN KEY)
   ```

2. **The Problem**:
   - When test cases are updated/edited, their IDs change (new UUIDs generated)
   - Historical test results still reference the old test case IDs
   - UI query uses INNER JOIN which fails when referenced test cases don't exist
   - Result: "unknown error" displayed instead of historical test data

3. **Problematic Query** (PostgreSQL):
   ```sql
   SELECT tr.*, tc.name as test_case_name
   FROM test_results tr
   JOIN test_cases tc ON tr.test_case_id = tc.id  -- ← FAILS for orphaned references
   WHERE tr.prompt_id = $1
   ```

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

### **Database Query Fix**
Changed the INNER JOIN to LEFT JOIN with fallback logic:

```sql
SELECT 
    tr.*,
    COALESCE(tc.name, tr.test_case_name, 'Unknown Test Case') as test_case_name
FROM test_results tr
LEFT JOIN test_cases tc ON tr.test_case_id = tc.id  -- ← LEFT JOIN handles orphaned refs
WHERE tr.prompt_id = $1
```

### **Benefits of the Fix**:
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Shows historical test results even when test cases have changed
2. **Data Preservation**: No historical test data is lost
3. **User Experience**: No more "unknown error" messages
4. **Fallback Names**: Uses stored test case names or "Unknown Test Case" as fallback

### **Files Modified**:
- `services/prompt-service/src/postgres-database.ts` - Fixed getTestResults query
- Added COALESCE logic for test case name resolution
- Changed JOIN to LEFT JOIN for orphaned reference handling

## 📊 **Technical Impact**

### **Before Fix**:
- ❌ Test results disappeared after test case modifications
- ❌ "Unknown error" messages in UI
- ❌ Broken clear-and-rerun workflow
- ❌ Poor user experience

### **After Fix**:
- ✅ Historical test results remain visible
- ✅ Clear error messaging with fallback names
- ✅ Smooth clear-and-rerun workflow
- ✅ Improved data integrity handling

## 🔄 **Prevention Strategy**

### **Long-term Solutions** (for future implementation):
1. **Immutable Test Case IDs**: Don't regenerate IDs when editing test cases
2. **Cascade Delete Rules**: Properly handle test result cleanup when test cases are deleted
3. **Data Archiving**: Archive old test results instead of orphaning them
4. **Referential Integrity**: Add proper CASCADE/SET NULL constraints

### **Immediate Benefits**:
- Test deletion and clearing now works reliably
- UI remains stable after test operations
- Historical data is preserved and accessible
- Better error handling for edge cases

## 🎯 **Session Readiness**

This fix resolves the test instability issues, allowing us to proceed with today's planned prompt service development work without being blocked by test-related UI problems.

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Ready for Session 1 of prompt service development
