# SysML vs DADM Comparison
**Date**: July 7, 2025  
**Project**: Decision Analysis & Decision Management (DADM) Platform

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive comparison highlights the fundamental differences between traditional SysML-based system modeling and DADM's executable knowledge management approach. While SysML excels at static documentation and standardized notation, DADM transforms modeling into an active, intelligent process that drives real-world execution and continuous improvement.

- **Synchronization Issues**: Models drift from actual implementation
- **Limited Validation**: No automatic checking of requirement consistency
- **No Execution**: Models cannot be tested or validated in operation
- **Knowledge Silos**: Domain expertise not captured in the modeling process
