# DADM System Status, MVP, and Next Steps
**Date**: July 7, 2025  
**Project**: Decision Analysis and Decision Management (DADM) Platform  
**Status**: Advanced Prototype ‚Üí MVP Definition Phase

## Executive Summary

The DADM platform represents a paradigm shift from traditional process modeling tools like SysML/Cameo toward executable, AI-enhanced decision workflows. Unlike SysML where models remain static artifacts, DADM enables true **instantiation and execution** of process models, making it uniquely suited for complex acquisition programs where rapid iteration, domain expertise integration, and measurable outcomes are critical.

- ‚úó **Manual Updates**: Changes require extensive rework across documentation

### **DADM Advantages**
- ‚úÖ **Executable Processes**: Models become running workflows with measurable outcomes
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Instantiation**: Create process instances with real data and track execution
- ‚úÖ **AI-Enhanced Intelligence**: Workflows adapt and improve based on outcomes
- ‚úÖ **Living Documentation**: Models self-update based on execution results
- ‚úÖ **Rapid Iteration**: Changes propagate automatically through the system
