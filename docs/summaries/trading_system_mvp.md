# DADM Trading System MVP
**Date**: July 7, 2025  
**Project**: Decision Analysis and Decision Management (DADM) Platform

## Executive Summary

The DADM Trading System MVP demonstrates how the universal process model transforms financial decision-making from gut-based intuition into systematic, measurable, and continuously improving trading strategies. Unlike traditional trading systems that rely on static algorithms or emotional decisions, DADM creates adaptive trading intelligence that learns from every market interaction while maintaining complete transparency and accountability through "batting average" performance tracking.

This use case is particularly valuable because it provides **immediate feedback** (market results within seconds/minutes), **clear success metrics** (profit/loss), and **abundant test data** (historical market data), making it an ideal proving ground for DADM's decision-making capabilities.

## The Trading Challenge: Perfect DADM Application

## Universal Process Model: Options Trading Example

### **Scenario: Tesla Call Option Decision**
*Market opens, Tesla earnings report leaked positive, stock jumping, call options available*

### **Phase 1: Event Detection**
**Trading Scenario**: *Tesla stock price jumps 3% in pre-market on earnings leak*

```mermaid

**In the Tesla Example**: System detects unusual price movement (+3%), correlates with news event (earnings leak), recognizes historical pattern (earnings-driven volatility), triggers high-priority trading alert.

### **Phase 2: Objectives Definition**
**Trading Scenario**: *Primary objective: Capture volatility expansion, Target: 20% return in 2 days*
