**Direct answer:**

* Use the **fuller prompt** as your design/task spec. Store it in your project (e.g., as `UI-THEMING-TASK.md` or in a `/prompts` folder).
* The **“Example Command to LLM”** is what you actually give to your LLM agent or code assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) **when you want code generated** for a specific part of the task.

### Typical workflow

1. **Store the full prompt/spec** in your repo (for documentation, reference, onboarding, and reproducibility).

   * Example file: `/docs/UX-THEMING-GUIDE.md`
   * Purpose: **Context for contributors** or LLMs about overall goals and requirements.

2. **Copy/paste the “Example Command”** (or write a similar direct request) into your LLM or code generator when you need implementation code.

   * Use for:

     * Generating theme provider code
     * Building a toggle switch
     * Refactoring a specific page/component
     * Anything code-related, targeted and tactical

3. **Reference the full prompt** when briefing LLMs or teammates about the *whole* theming project, or to ensure the code stays aligned with your requirements.

4. **If you want LLM agents to always use the same prompt:**

   * Build your UI/codegen tool to “read” the full prompt from a file (like `THEME_SPEC.md`).
   * Pass the full spec as **system prompt/context** for all code generation related to UI theming.

### Summary Table

| What                           |     Store in Repo?    |                  Use in LLM Prompt?                  |                     Reference in Code?                     |
| ------------------------------ | :-------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
| Full Spec (Fuller Prompt)      |          Yes          |                  For project context                 | Optionally, as a docstring or comment for future reference |
| Example Command (Short Prompt) | No, unless as example | Yes (copy-paste directly for specific code requests) |                       No, not in code                      |

**Best Practice:**

* Store the full prompt as a “single source of truth” for requirements.
* Use short, targeted prompts to the LLM for implementation work.
* Reference the full prompt/spec in your README or developer docs so the requirements don’t get lost or ignored.
