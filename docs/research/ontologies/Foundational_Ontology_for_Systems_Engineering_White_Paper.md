## Executive Summary

This paper establishes a foundational ontology for systems engineering (SE), inspired by Barry Smith's Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), to counter dilution from over-theorization. It draws on practical experience in mechanical, electrical, controls, and SE domains, including ontology-driven LLM workflows that slash ICD/CDD modeling time from weeks to minutes. Core entities and relations form a traceable chain, distinguishing artifacts (e.g., aircraft) from true systems (e.g., hydraulics with mutual dependencies). Modular implementation via OWL, Git, and SHACL enables non-breaking evolution. This foundation paves the way for first-order logic (static formalization) and probabilistic extensions (handling uncertainty), prioritizing applied conversion of science to technology in engineering workflows.

## 1. Introduction

Systems engineering frequently grapples with ambiguous definitions, fostering "fruitless churn" in meta-models and theory-first "shields" that evade empirical testing. Over 30 years of hands-on experience—from programming on early computers in 1977 to LLM-accelerated acquisition modeling—reveal that effective SE converts requirements into testable, deployable concepts without rigid lock-in. 

This ontology, rooted in Smith's BFO, classifies continuants (enduring entities like components) and occurrents (time-bound like processes), sidestepping INCOSE-like vagueness by emphasizing dependence and systemic unity. It critiques over-theorizing, advocating that theory comprise ≤5% of efforts, serving as input for 95% application. For instance, LLM tools extract ontology instances from documents, enabling rapid prototyping of air vehicle models.

## 2. Core Ontological Definitions

The base ontology forms a relational chain, designed for modularity (e.g., OWL files with imports) to support extensions without breakage.

### 2.1 Entities

- **Requirement**: A specification continuant, derived from documents like ICDs (e.g., "system must achieve 500km range")
- **Constraint**: A quality entity limiting a Requirement (e.g., "weight < 100kg" or "cost ≤ $1M")
- **Component**: A material continuant (e.g., engine turbine blade)
- **Interface**: A relational boundary, topological in BFO terms (e.g., electrical connector)
- **Process**: An occurrent activity (e.g., fuel combustion generating thrust)
- **Function**: A realizable disposition (e.g., propulsion capability)

### 2.2 Relations (Directed, with Dependence)

These relations incorporate BFO-style dependence for traceability:

- `Requirement has_constraint Constraint`
- `Requirement specifies Component`
- `Component presents Interface`
- `Component performs Process`
- `Process realizes Function`
- `Function specifically_depends_upon Component`
- `Function is_triggered_by Event/Input`

### 2.3 Conceptual Model Diagram

    class REQ,CONST specLayer
    class COMP,INTF physLayer
    class PROC,FUNC behavLayer
    class EVENT eventLayer
```

This ontological chain enables complete traceability queries—from Requirements through Components to realized Functions—supporting systematic SE workflows in tools like Protégé, while maintaining clear layer separation for modular reasoning.

## 3. Distinction of Systems

Drawing from BFO, a system is a non-summative whole characterized by mutual specific dependence (MSD). 

### 3.1 Mathematical Definition

**S = ∑{cᵢ}** where **∀cⱼ, cₖ ∈ S, MSD(cⱼ, cₖ)**

(with MSD defined as **SD(cⱼ, cₖ) ∧ SD(cₖ, cⱼ)**, and SD as necessary existence dependence: if cⱼ exists, cₖ must exist for it).

### 3.2 Examples

- **Hydraulic system qualifies** (fluid MSD with pipes; removal breaks whole)
- **Aircraft does not** (it's a host artifact; subsystems like avionics may qualify)

### 3.3 Checklist for System Identification

| Criterion | Description | Example (Hydraulics) | Example (Aircraft) |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Non-Summative | More than part sum | Yes (interdependence) | No (assembly) |
| MSD Present | Mutual dependence | Yes (fluid-pipe) | No (wings detachable) |
| BFO Alignment | Continuants in unity | Yes | No |

## 4. Critiques of Current SE Practices

SE often prioritizes theory over application, diluting impact. Evidence from searches on SE best practices highlights over-reliance on untested models (e.g., INCOSE handbooks emphasize frameworks without validation metrics).

### 4.1 Theory as Shield

Meta-models serve as untested prototypes, shielding teams from documentation or testing amid naive management—echoing experiences where projects stalled in abstraction.

### 4.2 Overfocus on Theory

Engineering is 95% application; exceeding 5% theory breeds dilution (e.g., endless design patterns sans "show me" prototypes). **Critique**: This biases toward academia, ignoring field realities like constrained budgets.

### 4.3 Constraints for Innovation

Limited catalogs (e.g., approved bolts in aerospace) force simpler designs, fostering elegance. Experience shows constraints reduced risks in controls systems, contrasting unrestricted "blue-sky" approaches that fail in practice.

**Balanced evidence**: Web searches confirm BFO's application in domains like biology reduces churn, suggesting SE adoption could similarly streamline.

## 5. Modular Design for Non-Breaking Growth

To enable evolution without lock-in:

### 5.1 Implementation Strategy

- **Modularity**: Use OWL modules (e.g., base.owl importing entities.owl)
- **Versioning**: Git branches/commits with semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0 for core chain)
- **Validation**: SHACL shapes (e.g., Component must have minCount 1 Interface)
- **Syncing**: SPARQL queries for cross-version traceability

### 5.2 Workflow Example

LLM parses ICD to extract variants (e.g., 3 Components per Requirement) → SHACL validates consistency → Git merges ensure no downstream breakage in models like air vehicles. 

**Simulation test**: Code execution with NetworkX confirms chain integrity post-extension (graph structure preserved).

### 5.3 SPARQL Query Example

```sparql
SELECT ?function WHERE { 
  ?req specifies ?comp . 
  ?comp performs ?proc . 
  ?proc realizes ?function 
}
```

## 6. Mathematical Rigor

### 6.1 Mereological Foundations

Employ mereology for aggregates:

**Part(x,y) ⟺ P(x,y) ∧ x ≠ y**

### 6.2 Traceability Modeling

Traceability modeled as paths in graph **G = (E, R)**, where E = entities, R = relations.

### 6.3 Graph-Based Traceability Analysis

The foundational ontology forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) enabling systematic traceability analysis. Key graph properties:

- **Nodes**: 7 core entity types (Requirement, Constraint, Component, Interface, Process, Function, Event/Input)
- **Edges**: 7 directed relationships preserving semantic dependencies
- **Layers**: 4 conceptual layers (Specification → Physical → Behavioral → Event)
- **Paths**: Multiple traceability paths from Requirements to Functions

**Example Traceability Path**:
`Requirement → specifies → Component → performs → Process → realizes → Function`

This enables automated queries for requirements validation, impact analysis, and system verification across the ontological structure.

## 7. Applications

### 7.1 ICD/CDD Modeling

Parse documents → instantiate chain → generate conceptual models (e.g., air vehicle hydraulics) in minutes via LLMs, reducing manual effort.

### 7.2 Extension Pathway

Subsequent papers add System aggregates and Capabilities (dependent on Functions), with first-order logic for static variants and probabilistic methods (e.g., Bayes for uncertainty).

### 7.3 Workflow Benefits

| Step | Traditional Time | Ontology-LLM Time | Benefit |
|------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Extract Entities | Weeks | Minutes | Automation |
| Validate Chain | Days | Seconds (SHACL) | Consistency |
| Merge Variants | Manual churn | Git auto | Non-breaking |
