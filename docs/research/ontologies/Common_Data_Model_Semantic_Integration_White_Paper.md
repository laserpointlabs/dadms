## Abstract

Modern systems engineering faces a critical challenge in integrating heterogeneous specifications across diverse domains, each with distinct vocabularies, data structures, and semantic assumptions. This paper presents a Common Data Model (CDM) approach that leverages a minimalist baseline ontology as a semantic anchor for probabilistic extraction, alignment, and integration of specification semantics. The CDM provides a unified data layer that preserves domain-specific nuances while enabling systematic cross-specification analysis, traceability, and interoperability.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Integration Challenge

Contemporary systems engineering operates in an environment where specifications originate from multiple sources: JCIDS documents from defense acquisition, MIL-STD specifications for technical standards, industry proprietary formats, and legacy system documentation. Each source employs domain-specific terminology, implicit assumptions, and varied data structures, creating semantic silos that impede:

- **Cross-domain traceability** from high-level mission requirements to detailed technical specifications
- **Consistency validation** across interdependent specification documents  
- **Change impact analysis** when modifications propagate across specification boundaries
- **Automated analysis** requiring unified data representations for algorithmic processing

### 1.2 Semantic Backbone Requirements

Effective integration requires a **common semantic backbone** that:

- Preserves the semantic richness of source specifications without loss of domain-specific meaning
- Provides formal relationships enabling automated reasoning and consistency checking
- Supports extensibility as new specification types and domains are encountered
- Maintains auditability with clear provenance tracking from CDM elements to source specifications

### 1.3 Ontology-Driven Integration

Ontologies provide the formal semantic foundation for this integration by:

- **Extracting** implicit semantic structures from natural language specifications
- **Aligning** disparate terminologies to common conceptual frameworks
- **Unifying** heterogeneous data representations through formal relationship modeling
- **Validating** consistency across integrated specification sets through logical reasoning

## 2. Baseline Ontology as Integration Anchor

### 2.1 Minimalist Core Design

The CDM employs a **thin baseline ontology** comprising 10 essential entities that capture the fundamental semantics common across systems engineering specifications:

| Entity | Definition | Integration Role |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Requirement** | Specification of what must be achieved | Anchor for traceability chains |
| **Component** | Physical or logical system element | Common reference for implementation |
| **Function** | Realizable capability or behavior | Abstraction layer for diverse implementations |
| **Process** | Time-bound activity sequence | Operational behavior modeling |
| **Interface** | Interaction boundary between components | Integration point specification |
| **System** | Non-summative whole with interdependent parts | Hierarchical organization anchor |
| **Capability** | Aggregated functions enabling mission objectives | Mission-level integration point |
| **Role** | Contextual purpose assignment | Flexible component-context binding |
| **Context** | Operational and environmental framework | Situational semantics container |
| **Mission** | High-level objective requiring system employment | Top-level integration anchor |

### 2.2 Grounding Properties

This baseline provides **semantic grounding** by:

- **Minimal Commitment**: Avoiding over-specification that constrains domain-specific extensions
- **Maximum Coverage**: Capturing essential relationships across systems engineering domains
- **Formal Precision**: Enabling automated reasoning while remaining human-interpretable
- **Extension Points**: Providing clear attachment points for domain-specific specializations

### 2.3 Relationship Framework

Core relationships establish the semantic backbone:

```
Mission requires→ Capability aggregates→ Function realizes→ Process performs→ Component
     ↓                    ↓                  ↓              ↓              ↓
   Context ←contextualizes Role ←assigned_to Function    Process     Component
     ↓                                       ↓              ↓              ↓
   affects→ Performance              realizes→ Process     utilizes→   Interface
```

## 3. Ontology Extraction and Alignment

### 3.1 Probabilistic Extraction Framework

The CDM construction process begins with **probabilistic ontology extraction** from source specifications:

**Phase 1: Initial Extraction**
- LLM-based semantic parsing of specification documents
- Entity recognition using baseline ontology as semantic templates
- Relationship extraction with confidence scoring
- Uncertainty quantification for ambiguous or incomplete information

**Phase 2: Convergence Analysis**
- Multiple extraction iterations to assess stability
- Statistical analysis of entity and relationship consistency
- Identification of persistent ambiguities requiring expert resolution
- Confidence scoring based on cross-iteration agreement

**Phase 3: Clustering and Harmonization**
- Semantic similarity analysis to group equivalent concepts
- Conflict detection between overlapping specifications
- Term harmonization using baseline ontology as reference framework
- Creation of aligned ontology sets ready for CDM integration

### 3.2 Alignment Metrics

**Extraction Stability:**
```
Stability(entity) = 1 - σ(confidence_scores) / μ(confidence_scores)
```

**Semantic Alignment:**
```
Alignment(term₁, term₂) = cosine_similarity(embedding₁, embedding₂) × context_overlap
```

**Convergence Threshold:**
```
Convergence = Σ|Ontology(i,n) - Ontology(i,n-1)| / |Total_Structure| < threshold
```

### 3.3 Quality Assurance

Critical alignment validation ensures:
- **Completeness**: All source specification concepts mapped to CDM elements
- **Consistency**: No contradictory mappings between equivalent concepts
- **Traceability**: Clear provenance from CDM elements to source specifications
- **Extensibility**: Alignment preserves ability to integrate additional specifications

## 4. Constructing the Common Data Model (CDM)

### 4.1 OWL-to-Logical Mapping Rules

The CDM transforms aligned ontologies into implementable data structures using systematic mapping rules:

| OWL Construct | CDM Representation | Implementation |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Class** | Entity/Table | Database table with primary key |
| **Object Property** | Relationship | Foreign key relationships or junction tables |
| **Data Property** | Attribute | Table columns with appropriate data types |
| **Subclass** | Inheritance | Table inheritance or type discrimination |
| **Restriction** | Constraint | Database constraints and validation rules |
| **Annotation** | Metadata | Provenance and documentation fields |

### 4.2 Conflict Resolution Strategies

**Terminology Conflicts:**
- Baseline ontology terms take precedence as canonical references
- Domain-specific terms mapped to baseline with explicit specialization relationships
- Synonym management through equivalence tables

**Structural Conflicts:**
- Hierarchical conflicts resolved through multiple inheritance or role-based modeling
- Relationship conflicts addressed via context-dependent relationship types
- Constraint conflicts managed through conditional constraint application

**Semantic Conflicts:**
- Expert adjudication for irreconcilable semantic differences
- Parallel representation with explicit conflict documentation
- Context-dependent resolution based on operational scenarios

### 4.3 CDM Schema Generation

**Automated Schema Construction:**
```sql
-- Example: Requirement entity with provenance
CREATE TABLE CDM_Requirement (
    requirement_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    classification VARCHAR(50),
    confidence_score FLOAT,
    source_specification VARCHAR(100),
    extraction_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    baseline_mapping VARCHAR(50) -- Maps to baseline ontology concept
);

-- Example: Component-Function relationship
CREATE TABLE CDM_Component_Function (
    component_id UUID REFERENCES CDM_Component(component_id),
    function_id UUID REFERENCES CDM_Function(function_id),
    relationship_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'realizes', 'supports', etc.
    confidence_score FLOAT,
    source_specification VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (component_id, function_id, relationship_type)
);
```

## 5. Scalability with Multiple Specifications

### 5.1 Hub-and-Spoke Architecture

The CDM employs a **hub-and-spoke model** for scalable integration:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Integration Hub"
        CDM[Common Data Model]
        BASELINE[Baseline Ontology]
    end
    
    subgraph "Specification Sources"
        JCIDS[JCIDS Documents]
        MILSTD[MIL-STD Specifications]  
        VENDOR[Vendor Specifications]
        LEGACY[Legacy Documentation]
    end
    
    subgraph "Domain Extensions"
        DEFENSE[Defense Domain Ontology]
        AEROSPACE[Aerospace Domain Ontology]
        MARITIME[Maritime Domain Ontology]
    end
    
    BASELINE --> CDM
    
    JCIDS --> CDM
    MILSTD --> CDM
    VENDOR --> CDM
    LEGACY --> CDM
    
    DEFENSE --> BASELINE
    AEROSPACE --> BASELINE
    MARITIME --> BASELINE
    
    CDM --> QUERIES[Integrated Queries]
    CDM --> ANALYSIS[Cross-Specification Analysis]
    CDM --> REPORTS[Unified Reporting]
```

### 5.2 Anchor Specification Strategy

**Optional Anchor Specification:**
- Designate one specification as the "anchor" for establishing canonical terminology
- Other specifications aligned to anchor through semantic mapping
- Reduces semantic drift and provides stability reference
- Enables progressive integration without complete re-alignment

**Dynamic Re-anchoring:**
- Capability to change anchor specification as requirements evolve
- Automated re-alignment based on new anchor selection
- Preservation of historical alignment decisions for audit purposes

### 5.3 Domain-Specific Integration

**Import Mechanism:**
```owl
@prefix baseline: <http://ontology.example.com/baseline#> .
@prefix jcids: <http://ontology.example.com/jcids#> .

jcids:CapabilityRequirement rdfs:subClassOf baseline:Requirement ;
    rdfs:comment "JCIDS-specific requirement type with additional metadata" .

jcids:hasThreshold rdfs:subPropertyOf baseline:has_constraint ;
    rdfs:domain jcids:CapabilityRequirement ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float .
```

       COUNT(shared.function_id) as shared_functions
FROM CDM_Capability c1, CDM_Capability c2,
     CDM_Capability_Function cf1, CDM_Capability_Function cf2,
     (SELECT cf1.function_id FROM CDM_Capability_Function cf1 
      INTERSECT 
      SELECT cf2.function_id FROM CDM_Capability_Function cf2) shared
WHERE c1.source_specification != c2.source_specification
