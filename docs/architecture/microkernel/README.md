# DADMS 2.0 - Microkernel Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the DADMS 2.0 Microkernel Execution Architecture - a revolutionary approach that transforms decision execution from static service orchestration to dynamic process-thread execution.

## 🧠 Core Concept

The microkernel architecture replaces DADMS's rigid, hard-coded service orchestrator with a flexible, programmable execution core that behaves like a software CPU—capable of managing and running process definitions like threads on a chip.
