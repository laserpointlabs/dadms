# DADMS 2.0 â€“ Ontology Workspace Service Specification

## Executive Summary

The Ontology Workspace service provides a visual, collaborative environment for authoring, editing, and validating ontologies within the DADMS ecosystem. This service bridges the gap between automated ontology extraction (Ontology Builder) and practical ontology engineering, offering intuitive graph-based editing tools, multi-format import/export capabilities, and seamless integration with triple stores and web publishing platforms.

**ðŸ†• MAJOR UPDATE**: This specification now includes comprehensive ontology versioning and ripple effect management capabilities through DAS-assisted change management. See [Ontology Workspace Versioning Extension](./ontology_workspace_versioning_extension.md) for complete details on advanced versioning features.

## 1. Purpose & Responsibilities

### 1.1 Core Purpose

The Ontology Workspace serves as the comprehensive visual ontology engineering environment, providing:

- **Visual Ontology Authoring**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating and editing ontologies
- **Standards Compliance**: Support for OWL, Turtle, RDF/XML, and ROBOT formats
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multi-user sessions with real-time collaboration and change tracking
- **Publishing Integration**: Seamless publishing to Fuseki triple stores and web documentation
- **Tool Integration**: Integration with professional ontology tools like Cemento and draw.io
- **Validation & Quality**: Live validation, consistency checking, and quality metrics
- **ðŸ†• Advanced Versioning**: Comprehensive version management with ecosystem-wide impact analysis and DAS-assisted migration

### 1.2 Key Responsibilities

#### Visual Ontology Engineering
- Provide intuitive graph-based editing interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- Support hierarchical class structures, property definitions, and relationship modeling
- Enable visual representation of complex ontological patterns and constraints
- Auto-layout algorithms for optimal ontology visualization and organization
- Color coding and grouping for different ontology components (classes, properties, individuals)

#### Multi-Format Import/Export
- Support import from OWL, Turtle, RDF/XML, ROBOT, and JSON-LD formats
- Enable export to multiple standard ontology formats with validation
- Integration with external tools (Cemento, draw.io, ProtÃ©gÃ©) for advanced editing
- Bulk import/export operations for large ontology sets
- Format conversion utilities with lossless transformation guarantees

#### Publishing & Documentation
- Generate human-readable ontology documentation (HTML, Markdown, PDF)
- Publish ontologies to Apache Jena Fuseki for SPARQL querying
- Create interactive web-based ontology browsers and explorers
- Support for ontology versioning and change documentation
- Integration with static site generators for comprehensive documentation sites

#### Collaboration & Workflow
- Real-time collaborative editing with conflict resolution
- Role-based permissions for ontology authoring and publishing
- Comment and discussion threads on ontology elements
- Change tracking, approval workflows, and audit trails
- Integration with project management and decision workflows

#### Validation & Quality Assurance
- Live ontology validation using OWL reasoners (HermiT, Pellet, ELK)
- Consistency checking and error highlighting in visual interface
- Quality metrics and best practice recommendations
- Integration with Ontology Manager for usage analytics and impact assessment
- Automated testing and continuous integration for ontology changes

#### ðŸ†• Advanced Version Management & Ecosystem Integration
- **Comprehensive Versioning**: Semantic versioning with ecosystem-wide impact tracking
- **DAS-Assisted Change Management**: Intelligent prediction and mitigation of ripple effects
- **Migration Orchestration**: Sophisticated migration planning and execution across DADMS
- **Dependency Intelligence**: Real-time tracking of dependencies across data models, mappings, and synthetic datasets
- **Emergency Response**: Automated detection and response to ontology-related issues
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Intelligent notification and change management
- **DataManager Integration**: Synchronized versioning with data and domain mapping systems
