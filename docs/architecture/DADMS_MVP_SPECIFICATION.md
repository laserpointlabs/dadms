## MVP User Experience Flow

### **Intelligent, Proactive Experience**:

1. **User creates project** â†’ Event published â†’ AAS welcomes user with personalized guidance
2. **User uploads documents** â†’ Event published â†’ AAS suggests next steps and templates
3. **User designs process** â†’ Event published â†’ AAS offers intelligent workflow suggestions
4. **Process runs** â†’ Events published â†’ AAS monitors and proactively assists
5. **Issues occur** â†’ Events published â†’ AAS detects and fixes problems automatically

### **Example AAS Interactions**:

**Scenario 1: User on Process Designer**
```
AAS: "I see you're designing a UAV workflow. Based on your project context, 
     I recommend adding these service tasks: cost analysis, risk assessment, 
     and design validation. Want me to create this template for you?"

User: "Yes, please"

AAS: *automatically creates the workflow template with proper service tasks*
```

**Scenario 2: Process Stuck**
```
AAS: "Your cost analysis process has been waiting for 30 minutes. 
     I checked the logs and found the issue - the LLM service is down. 
     I've restarted it for you. The process should resume in 2 minutes."
```

**Scenario 3: User Asks for Help**
```
User: "What should I do next?"

AAS: "Looking at your UAV project, you've completed the design phase. 
     The next logical step is to run the cost analysis. I can start that 
     process for you right now. Would you like me to?"
```

5. **Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance**

## Why This MVP is Special

### **Without Event Bus + AAS:**
- Static workflow execution
- Manual monitoring and debugging
- No proactive assistance
- Just another BPMN tool

### **With Event Bus + AAS:**
- **Live, intelligent system** that responds to user needs
- **Proactive problem detection** and resolution
- **Context-aware assistance** that feels magical
- **Differentiated product** that stands out in the market

This MVP will demonstrate the true potential of DADMS as an intelligent decision assistant, not just a workflow tool.
