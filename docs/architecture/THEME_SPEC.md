Here is a **ready-to-use `THEME_SPEC.md`** for your repo. This is written as a clear, comprehensive spec to ensure **consistent, robust light/dark theming** for your UI, and to guide both developers and LLM agents.

---

# UI Theme Specification (`THEME_SPEC.md`)

## Purpose

Define a **consistent, modern theming system** for all user interfaces in the DATMS project. Ensure all pages, components, and workflows adhere to unified light and dark themes, with full support for accessibility, user preference, and maintainability.

---

## 1. **Design System**

* **Framework:** Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) or equivalent.
* **Color Palette:** Define a full palette for both light and dark modes, covering:

  * Background
  * Surface (cards, panels)
  * Primary/Secondary
  * Text (main, secondary, disabled)
  * Border
  * Accent/Highlight
  * Error/Warning/Success
* **Typography:** Use a consistent font family and typographic scale.
* **Spacing:** Apply a rational, consistent spacing system (margin, padding, gap).

---

## 2. **Theme Switching**

* **Theme Toggle:**

  * Add a toggle (button or switch) accessible from the header, sidebar, or settings.
  * On toggle, all UI elements must update to the selected theme instantly.
* **Persistence:**

  * Store user preference (e.g., in `localStorage`).
  * On first load, default to system `prefers-color-scheme` if no preference set.
* **Live Adaptation:**

  * All components must respond to theme changes without requiring a page reload.

---

## 3. **Implementation Guidelines**

* **No Hardcoding:**

  * Do not hardcode colors or backgrounds.
  * Use theme tokens, CSS variables, or Tailwind config for all color/style references.
* **Component Library:**

  * All new and existing components must consume theme variables/tokens.
  * Refactor any legacy components/pages that do not comply.
* **Consistency:**

  * All pages, overlays, modals, navbars, sidebars, and dialogs must visually match the theme.
  * Avoid using arbitrary colors.

---

## 4. **Accessibility**

* **Contrast:**

  * All text/background and interactive elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (use AAA where feasible).
* **Focus States:**

  * Provide clear, visible focus indicators in both themes.
* **Font Size:**

  * Use readable, scalable font sizes.
* **Testing:**

  * Test both themes with color-blind simulators and accessibility tools.

---

## 5. **Quality & Review**

* **Audit:**

  * Regularly review for color/style consistency across pages.
  * Test all components in both themes before merge.
* **Documentation:**

  * Maintain a theme reference table or design tokens file.
  * Document any new colors or theme-specific component states.
* **Extensibility:**

  * Support custom accent colors if needed.
  * Plan for future theme expansion (e.g., high-contrast, custom branding).

---

## 6. **LLM & Automation Guidance**

* Any code or UI generated by LLMs or automation must:

  * Use the defined theme tokens/variables.
  * Reference this `THEME_SPEC.md` for requirements.
  * Include both light and dark variants for every component.
* LLM prompts should include:

  ```
  Always follow the current THEME_SPEC.md. All UI code must be fully compatible with both light and dark themes, using only defined theme tokens. No hardcoded colors.
  ```

---

## 7. **Sample Theme Tokens**

```js
// Example theme tokens (Tailwind config or CSS variables)
:root {
  --color-bg: #ffffff;
  --color-bg-dark: #101013;
  --color-surface: #f6f6f8;
  --color-surface-dark: #18181b;
  --color-primary: #2563eb;
  --color-primary-dark: #60a5fa;
  --color-text: #111927;
  --color-text-dark: #e5e7eb;
  // etc.
}
```

**(Expand as needed for your stack/tooling.)**

Update this document as the theming system evolves.
All UI work—by humans or AI—must follow this specification.
