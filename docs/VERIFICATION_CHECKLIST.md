# DADM Decoupled Analysis System - Verification Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist ✅

### Service Files & Configuration
- [ ] **Analysis Service Enhanced**
  - [ ] `service_integrations.py` - HTTP-only service communication layer
  - [ ] Updated `service.py` with new endpoints (`/analyze/integrated`, `/analyze/computational`)
  - [ ] Enhanced `models.py` with service URLs (`openai_service_url`, `python_execution_url`)
  - [ ] Updated `config_manager.py` with new environment variables
  - [ ] Enhanced `requirements.txt` with `aiohttp`, `python-consul`

- [ ] **Python Execution Service Created**
  - [ ] `service.py` - FastAPI service with Docker execution capabilities
  - [ ] `config_manager.py` - Robust configuration management
  - [ ] `service_config.json` - Service metadata and Consul registration info
  - [ ] `requirements.txt` - All dependencies including scientific packages
  - [ ] `Dockerfile` - Container build configuration
  - [ ] `test_config.py` - Configuration validation utility

- [ ] **Docker Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Updated `docker-compose.yml` with Python execution service
  - [ ] Service environment variables properly configured
  - [ ] Network connectivity between services configured
  - [ ] Volume mounts for Docker-in-Docker execution

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] `DECOUPLED_ANALYSIS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete architecture guide
  - [ ] `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Achievement summary
  - [ ] `README_INTEGRATED_ANALYSIS.md` - Quick start guide
  - [ ] `test_decoupled_architecture.py` - System verification script

### Service Discovery & Registration
- [ ] **Consul Integration**
  - [ ] All services register with Consul on startup
  - [ ] Health checks configured for all services
  - [ ] Service metadata properly populated
  - [ ] Graceful deregistration on shutdown

- [ ] **Environment Variables**
  - [ ] Analysis Service: `ANALYSIS_OPENAI_SERVICE_URL`, `ANALYSIS_PYTHON_EXECUTION_URL`
  - [ ] Python Execution: `USE_CONSUL=true`, `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR=consul:8500`
  - [ ] All services: `SERVICE_HOST` properly set for containerized deployment

### Communication Patterns
- [ ] **Service Discovery Flow**
  - [ ] Services use Consul to discover each other dynamically
  - [ ] Fallback to configured URLs when Consul unavailable
  - [ ] No hardcoded service URLs in production code

- [ ] **HTTP-Only Communication**
  - [ ] Zero direct imports between services
  - [ ] All communication via REST API calls
  - [ ] Proper error handling and timeout management
  - [ ] Circuit breaker patterns implemented

### Security & Isolation
- [ ] **Python Execution Security**
  - [ ] Docker-based isolated execution environments
  - [ ] Resource limits (memory: 512MB, timeout: 300s)
  - [ ] Read-only data access where possible
  - [ ] No network access for execution containers

- [ ] **Service Security**
  - [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
  - [ ] Structured output schemas prevent injection
  - [ ] No sensitive information in error messages
  - [ ] Environment variables for secret management

## Deployment Verification

### Step 1: Start Services
```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 2: Verify Service Health
```bash
# Check all services are running
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Analysis Service
curl http://localhost:8003/health  # Python Execution Service
curl http://localhost:5300/health  # Prompt Service
curl http://localhost:5000/health  # OpenAI Service
```

### Step 3: Verify Consul Registration
```bash
# Check Consul dashboard
open http://localhost:8500

# Verify services are registered
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/agent/services | jq
```

### Step 4: Test Service Discovery
```bash
# Test service discovery from analysis service
curl http://localhost:8002/service/info
```

### Step 5: Test Integrated Analysis
```bash
# Test end-to-end analysis workflow
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/analyze/integrated" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "analysis_type": "test_analysis",
    "data_sources": {"test_data": [1,2,3,4,5]},
    "execution_tools": ["python"]
  }'
```

### Step 6: Test Python Execution Service
```bash
# Test direct Python execution
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8003/execute" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "code": "import numpy as np\nprint(f\"Mean: {np.mean([1,2,3,4,5])}\")",
    "environment": "scientific"
  }'
```

### Step 7: Run Architecture Tests
```bash
# Run comprehensive architecture verification
python3 scripts/test_decoupled_architecture.py
```

## Success Criteria ✅

### ✅ Service Health
- All services return `status: "healthy"` from `/health` endpoints
- Docker containers are running and stable
- No error messages in service logs

### ✅ Service Discovery
- All DADM services visible in Consul dashboard
- Health checks passing (green status)
- Services can discover each other dynamically

### ✅ Integration Tests
- Analysis service can call OpenAI service for LLM analysis
- Analysis service can call Python execution service for computation
- Python execution service can run code in isolated containers
- End-to-end analysis workflow completes successfully

### ✅ Decoupling Verification
- No direct imports between services (verified by code inspection)
- Services communicate only via HTTP REST APIs
- Services can start/stop independently without affecting others
- Service URLs resolved dynamically via Consul

### ✅ Error Handling
- Services handle downstream failures gracefully
- Timeout and retry logic working correctly
- Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascade failures
- Meaningful error messages returned to clients

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Services Not Registering with Consul
**Symptoms**: Services not visible in Consul dashboard
**Solutions**:
- Check `USE_CONSUL=true` environment variable
- Verify `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR=consul:8500` is correct
- Check network connectivity to Consul service
- Review service logs for registration errors

#### Service Discovery Failures
**Symptoms**: Services can't find each other
**Solutions**:
- Verify services are registered in Consul
- Check health checks are passing
- Ensure service names match discovery queries
- Verify network connectivity between containers

#### Python Execution Timeouts
**Symptoms**: Python code execution fails with timeouts
**Solutions**:
- Increase timeout value in request
- Check Docker daemon is running
- Verify container resource limits
- Review execution logs for bottlenecks

#### Analysis Integration Failures
**Symptoms**: Integrated analysis returns errors
**Solutions**:
- Check OpenAI API key configuration
- Verify all services are healthy
- Test individual service endpoints
- Review service logs for specific errors

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Health Checks
```bash
# Daily health verification
curl -s http://localhost:8002/health | jq '.status'
curl -s http://localhost:8003/health | jq '.status'
```

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor service logs
docker-compose logs -f analysis-service
docker-compose logs -f python-execution-service
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Check active executions
curl -s http://localhost:8003/health | jq '.active_executions'

# Monitor response times
time curl -s http://localhost:8002/health > /dev/null
```
