# API Development Best Practices â€“ DADMS 2.0

This document outlines the approved best practices for API development in DADMS 2.0. All team members should follow this guidance for every new service and endpoint.

---

## API Development Sequence

1. **Generate OpenAPI (Swagger) YAML/JSON Spec First**
   - Create a formal, machine-readable contract for the API before implementation.
   - Enables parallel frontend/backend work, auto-generation of code/docs, and clear team alignment.
   - Include all endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication, and error models.

2. **Review and Iterate on the API Spec**
   - Share the OpenAPI spec with the team for feedback.
   - Catch design issues, missing fields, or unclear flows before coding.
   - Ensure all stakeholders (frontend, backend, QA, etc.) agree on the contract.

3. **Start Implementation (Backend and/or Frontend)**
   - Use the agreed-upon OpenAPI spec to scaffold code, generate types, and write tests.
   - Implement endpoints, business logic, and data models as specified.

4. **Repeat for Each Service**
   - Apply this process to every new microservice or major API addition.
   - Keeps the architecture consistent, maintainable, and well-documented.

## Approval and Documentation Process

- **Team Lead Approval:**
  - The team lead (user) will review and approve all best practices before they are documented and adopted.
  - Once approved, best practices will be added to this document and become the standard for the project.

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - This document is a living reference and will be updated as new best practices are approved.

**All API development in DADMS 2.0 must follow this approved sequence and documentation process.**
