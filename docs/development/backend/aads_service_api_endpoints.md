## Integration Points

### BPMN Process Integration
- Decision reviews are created from completed BPMN process instances
- Process context (variables, tasks, outcomes) is automatically extracted
- Approval workflows are managed by the BPMN engine (Camunda)

### LLM Service Integration
- AI assistant interactions use the LLM Service for natural language processing
- White paper generation leverages LLM capabilities for content creation
- Context injection includes process data, project information, and historical decisions

### Knowledge Service Integration
- Background knowledge and documents are accessible during decision review
- Generated white papers are stored in the knowledge base for future reference
- Similarity analysis helps identify related decisions and precedents

### Event Bus Integration
- Decision lifecycle events are published for system-wide awareness
- Approval status changes trigger notifications to relevant stakeholders
- Audit trail events are captured for compliance and governance

---

## Error Handling

All endpoints use standardized error responses:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Required field 'title' is missing",
    "details": "Field validation failed for decision review creation"
  }
}
```

Common error codes:
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Request validation failed
- `NOT_FOUND`: Resource not found
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: Authentication required
- `FORBIDDEN`: Insufficient permissions
- `PROCESS_NOT_FOUND`: Referenced process instance not found
- `APPROVAL_WORKFLOW_ERROR`: BPMN workflow error

---

## Authentication & Authorization

- All endpoints require JWT authentication except `/health`
- Users can only access decision reviews they created or are participants in
- Approval permissions are validated against user roles and workflow definitions
- AI assistant interactions are logged for audit purposes

---

## Performance Considerations

- Decision review listings are paginated for large datasets
- White paper exports are cached for frequently accessed documents
- AI assistant responses include confidence scoring for quality assessment
- Approval workflows support asynchronous processing for complex multi-step approvals
