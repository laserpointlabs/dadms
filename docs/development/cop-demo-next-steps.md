## ðŸš€ Immediate Actions Required

### Next Sprint Planning Session
**When**: Next development session  
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Goal**: Begin Sprint 1 implementation

### Priority 1: Complete Task Orchestrator Foundation (1-2 days)
**Current State**: Basic structure created, types defined  
**Next Steps**:
1. Complete service implementation (`dadms-services/task-orchestrator/src/`)
2. Database schema updates for workflow management
3. Basic REST API endpoints for workflow control
4. Integration with existing LLM service

### Priority 2: MVP Persona Implementation (2-3 days)
**Goal**: Get basic 4-persona workflow running  
**Focus**: Scripted intelligent behavior rather than full AI reasoning  
**Deliverable**: End-to-end demo flow in development environment

### Priority 3: PM Dashboard Creation (1-2 days)
**Goal**: Real-time monitoring interface for Program Manager  
**Features**: Workflow progress, persona status, artifact generation tracking  
**Technology**: React/TypeScript UI with WebSocket connections

## ðŸ“‹ Sprint 1 Checklist

### Week 1 Foundation Goals

## ðŸ”§ Development Environment Setup

### Required Services
```bash
# Ensure all infrastructure is running
docker-compose up -d postgres qdrant redis

# Start existing services
npm run dev --workspace=@dadms/llm
npm run dev --workspace=@dadms/knowledge

# Start new orchestrator service (once implemented)
npm run dev --workspace=@dadms/task-orchestrator

# Start UI with COP demo components
npm run dev --workspace=@dadms/ui
```

### Port Allocation Confirmation
- **UI**: 3000 (PM Dashboard with COP demo interface)
- **LLM Service**: 3002 (Enhanced with persona prompts)
- **Knowledge Service**: 3003 (Enhanced with standards parsing)
- **Task Orchestrator**: 3017 (New service for workflow management)
- **Code Generator**: 3018 (New service for artifact generation)
- **COP Visualization**: 3019 (New service for tactical displays)

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Strategy

### MVP-First Approach
1. **Start Simple**: Basic workflow with mock data and template responses
2. **Add Intelligence Gradually**: Enhance persona behaviors incrementally
3. **Focus on Demo Experience**: Prioritize smooth presentation over technical perfection
4. **Iterative Enhancement**: Improve based on demo feedback and testing

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Fallback Scenarios**: Pre-recorded demo segments if live demo fails
2. **Performance Buffers**: Target 25-minute execution for 35-minute demo window
3. **Mock Data Ready**: Realistic sample documents and artifacts prepared
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of common failure scenarios

### Quality Assurance
1. **Daily Demo Runs**: Test complete workflow every development day
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and resource usage
3. **Stakeholder Reviews**: Regular check-ins on value proposition alignment
4. **Technical Reviews**: Code quality and architecture validation

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics Tracking

### Development Progress
- **Sprint Velocity**: Tasks completed per day
- **Quality Metrics**: Test coverage, code review completion
- **Integration Success**: Service compatibility and stability
- **Performance Trends**: Response time improvements over time

### Demo Readiness
- **Execution Success Rate**: Percentage of successful complete runs
- **Timing Consistency**: Standard deviation of demo execution time
- **Artifact Quality**: Manual review scores of generated outputs
- **User Experience**: Feedback scores from internal stakeholders

## ðŸŽ¯ Long-term Vision Alignment

### Beyond MVP
