# DADMS Development Process Capture

## Purpose
This document captures the ongoing development process, key decisions, rationale, and milestones for the DADMS 2.0 project. It serves as a living record to ensure transparency, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement.

---

## Process Overview
- **Scaffold First:** Rapidly prototype UI/UX with local state and placeholder data.
- **Iterate on UX:** Validate workflows and get feedback before backend integration.
- **API Integration:** Replace local state with real API/database calls once UI is validated.
- **Continuous Documentation:** Update this document as decisions are made and milestones are reached.

---

## Key Decisions & Rationale
- **UI Scaffolding:** Use local state for domains/tags to enable fast iteration and feedback.
- **Domain/Tag Model:** Domains and tags are managed centrally for governance and reusability. Tags can span multiple domains (multi-select).
- **Separation of Concerns:** Frontend handles UX, backend handles chunking, vectorization, and storage.
- **Best Practice Alignment:** Follow modern SaaS and knowledge management patterns for extensibility and maintainability.

---

## Milestones & Progress
- **Day 1:** Project CRUD UI and backend complete.
- **Day 2:** Knowledge page scaffolded; Domain and Tag management UIs scaffolded with local state.
- **Next:** Document upload and RAG search UI scaffolding; backend API integration for knowledge entities.

---

## Next Steps
- Scaffold Document Upload and Knowledge Search UIs.
- Define and implement backend API endpoints for domains, tags, documents, and search.
- Integrate frontend with backend for persistent data.
- Continue to update this document as new decisions and milestones occur.
