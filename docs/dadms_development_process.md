# DADMS Development Process Capture

## Purpose
This document captures the ongoing development process, key decisions, rationale, and milestones for the DADMS 2.0 project. It serves as a living record to ensure transparency, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement.

---

## Process Overview
- **Scaffold First:** Rapidly prototype UI/UX with local state and placeholder data.
- **Iterate on UX:** Validate workflows and get feedback before backend integration.
- **API Integration:** Replace local state with real API/database calls once UI is validated.
- **Continuous Documentation:** Update this document as decisions and milestones are reached.

## UI Design System Implementation (2025-01-15)

### Problem Statement
The initial UI implementation had several critical issues:
- **Inconsistent Styling**: Mix of Material-UI and custom CSS across pages
- **Unprofessional Icons**: Using emoji icons instead of proper icon libraries
- **No Design System**: Lack of reusable components and consistent theming
- **Poor TypeScript Integration**: Missing proper type definitions for API integration

### Solution Approach

#### 1. **Unified Design System**
Created a comprehensive theme system (`design-system/theme.ts`) with:
- VS Code-inspired dark theme colors
- Consistent spacing, typography, and shadows
- Responsive breakpoints
- Transition animations

#### 2. **Shared Component Library**
Built reusable components in `components/shared/`:
- **Button**: Variants (primary, secondary, danger), loading states, icon support
- **Card**: Container components with consistent styling
- **Icon**: VS Code Codicons integration replacing all emoji usage
- **LoadingState**: Skeleton loaders and spinners
- **PageLayout**: Standardized page structure
- **Modal**: Consistent dialog implementation

#### 3. **Type Safety**
Created comprehensive TypeScript definitions:
- `types/api.ts`: Generic API response types
- `types/services/project.ts`: Project service types with proper enums
- `types/services/knowledge.ts`: Knowledge service types
- Field transformations between snake_case (API) and camelCase (TypeScript)

#### 4. **Migration Strategy**
- Started with Projects page as pilot implementation
- Demonstrated all new patterns and components
- Created migration checklist for remaining pages

### Key Learnings
1. **Start with Design System**: Having a unified theme prevents inconsistency
2. **Component-First Development**: Build shared components before page-specific ones
3. **Type Safety is Critical**: Proper TypeScript interfaces catch integration issues early
4. **Incremental Migration**: Pilot one page thoroughly before mass migration

### Next Steps
- Complete migration of remaining pages (Knowledge, LLM, Context, etc.)
- Add advanced components (DataTable, Forms, Charts)
- Implement accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Add Storybook for component documentation

---

## Development Tooling Update

- **pm2 for Local Process Management:** Adopted [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) as a process manager for local development. This replaces multiple terminal tabs with a unified process dashboard.
- **VS Code Integration:** Configured VS Code settings for optimal TypeScript development experience.
- **Docker for Infrastructure:** PostgreSQL, Qdrant, and Redis run in containers for consistency.

## Service Architecture Update (2025-01-09)

### Decision Capture: Service Boundaries

After scaffolding the initial UI, we refined service boundaries:

1. **Context Manager Service** - Added to manage AI personas, teams, and prompt templates
2. **BPMN Workspace Service** - Visual workflow design with Camunda integration  
3. **Process Manager Service** - Workflow execution and task management
4. **Thread Manager Service** - Decision thread tracking and feedback

Each service has:
- Clear REST API specification
- Dedicated UI page
- PostgreSQL schema design
- Integration patterns documented

---

## Frontend Scaffolding (2025-01-08)

### Approach
Built complete UI shell with:
- Next.js + TypeScript foundation
- VS Code-inspired layout (activity bar, sidebar, editor area)
- All service pages scaffolded with mock data
- Responsive design patterns

### Key Decisions
- **State Management**: React hooks for now, Redux/Zustand later if needed
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development
- **Component Structure**: Feature-based organization
- **API Layer**: Service abstraction for easy backend integration

---

## Initial Architecture (2025-01-07)

### Clean Microservices Design
- Each service owns its database schema
- REST APIs with OpenAPI documentation  
- Docker Compose for local orchestration
- Clear separation of concerns

### Technology Choices
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Express
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React + TypeScript
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (primary), Qdrant (vectors), Redis (cache)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Traefik gateway
