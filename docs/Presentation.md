## Slide 6: BPMN Workflow Configuration
**Service Task Integration with Camunda**

DADM uses standard BPMN 2.0 workflows with Camunda extension properties to specify how service tasks connect to microservices through the Service Orchestrator.

**Sample BPMN Workflow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    Start([Start Process]) --> Input[Collect Requirements]
    Input --> Analysis[AI Analysis Task]
    Analysis --> Review[Human Review]
    Review --> Decision{Approved?}
    Decision -->|Yes| Deploy[Deploy Solution]
    Decision -->|No| Revise[Revise Requirements]
    Revise --> Analysis
    Deploy --> End([End Process])
    
    style Analysis fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#4caf50
    style Review fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#ff9800
```

**Extension Properties for Service Tasks:**
```xml
<bpmn:serviceTask id="ai-analysis" name="AI Analysis">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <camunda:properties>
      <camunda:property name="service.name" value="openai" />
      <camunda:property name="service.type" value="assistant" />
      <camunda:property name="service.operation" value="analyze" />
      <camunda:property name="service.timeout" value="300" />
    </camunda:properties>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
```

**How It Works:**
- Service Orchestrator reads extension properties from BPMN tasks
- Routes requests to appropriate microservices based on `service.name`
- Handles different operations within services via `service.type` and `service.operation`
- Manages timeouts and error handling automatically

## Slide 7: Service Example - OpenAI Integration
**API Endpoints and Usage**

The OpenAI service demonstrates DADM's microservice approach with clean REST APIs that support complex decision analysis workflows.

**Service Endpoints:**
```
POST /openai/assistant/create
POST /openai/assistant/{id}/message
GET  /openai/assistant/{id}/status
POST /openai/files/upload
GET  /openai/files/{id}
```

**Example Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "Analyze supplier options for emergency equipment",
  "context": {
    "budget": 50000,
    "timeline": "30 days",
    "requirements": ["FDA approved", "rapid deployment"]
  }
}
```

**Response includes:** Analysis, recommendations, confidence scores, and supporting rationale
