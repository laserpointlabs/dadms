# Ontology-First Data Modeling Approach for DADMS

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the ontology-first approach to data modeling that DADMS 2.0 adopts. This approach ensures semantic consistency, domain alignment, and maintainable data architectures by building ontologies before creating data models. The methodology provides a structured path from domain understanding to implementable data structures while maintaining flexibility and adaptability.

## 1. Introduction

### Overview
The ontology-first approach is a methodology where ontologies are developed before data models, ensuring that data structures are built on a solid semantic foundation. This approach is particularly valuable in complex decision-making environments where semantic clarity and domain alignment are critical.

- **Domain Alignment**: Ensures data models reflect true domain concepts and relationships
- **Consistency**: Establishes consistent terminology and relationships across the system
- **Flexibility**: Allows ontologies to evolve independently of implementation details
- **Reusability**: Ontologies can be reused across multiple data models and systems
