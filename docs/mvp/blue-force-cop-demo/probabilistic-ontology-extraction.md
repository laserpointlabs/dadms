# Probabilistic Ontology Extraction - Advanced Feature Specification

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Overview

This advanced feature enhances the Blue Force COP demonstration with **question-guided probabilistic ontology extraction** - a sophisticated approach that uses targeted questions to guide extraction and employs iterative probabilistic sampling to converge on high-quality, comprehensive ontologies.

## ðŸ§  Conceptual Framework

### Traditional vs. Probabilistic Extraction

#### **Traditional Single-Pass Extraction**
- Parse document once with deterministic rules
- Extract concepts based on fixed patterns
- Single confidence score per extracted element
- Limited by initial extraction quality

#### **Question-Guided Probabilistic Extraction**
- Multiple extraction runs with different question focuses
- Probabilistic sampling of extraction strategies
- Iterative convergence toward consensus ontology
- Quality improvement through statistical aggregation

### Extraction Strategy Sampling

#### **Question Focus Sampling**
```typescript
interface QuestionFocus {
  category: 'structural' | 'semantic' | 'constraint';
  weight: number;
  questions: string[];
  extraction_emphasis: string;
}

class QuestionSampler {
  sampleQuestionSet(allQuestions: QuestionSet, iteration: number): QuestionFocus[] {
    // Sample different question combinations each iteration
    // Higher iterations focus on areas with low confidence
    // Ensure coverage across all question categories
  }
}
```

#### **Extraction Strategy Variation**
```typescript
interface ExtractionStrategy {
  approach: 'conservative' | 'aggressive' | 'balanced';
  confidence_threshold: number;
  relationship_depth: number;
  context_window: number;
}

class StrategySelector {
  selectStrategy(iteration: number, previousResults: ExtractionResult[]): ExtractionStrategy {
    // Early iterations: broad, aggressive extraction
    // Later iterations: focused, conservative refinement
    // Adapt based on previous extraction quality
  }
}
```

### Statistical Aggregation Methods

#### **Concept Consensus Building**
```typescript
interface ConceptCandidate {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  extraction_run: number;
  confidence: number;
  question_context: string[];
  supporting_evidence: string[];
}

class ConceptAggregator {
  aggregateConcepts(candidates: ConceptCandidate[]): ConceptConsensus {
    // 1. Cluster similar concepts using semantic similarity
    // 2. Weight by confidence and extraction quality
    // 3. Resolve naming conflicts through voting
    // 4. Merge descriptions with highest information content
  }
}
```

#### **Relationship Probability Calculation**
```typescript
interface RelationshipCandidate {
  source_concept: string;
  target_concept: string;
  relationship_type: string;
  confidence: number;
  extraction_context: string;
}

class RelationshipAggregator {
  calculateRelationshipProbability(candidates: RelationshipCandidate[]): number {
    // Weighted average of extraction confidences
    // Penalty for contradictory relationship types
    // Bonus for consistent extraction across multiple runs
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Convergence Criteria & Metrics

### Stability Metrics

#### **Concept Stability**
```typescript
interface StabilityMetrics {
  concept_variance: number;        // How much concepts change between iterations
  relationship_stability: number; // Consistency of relationship extraction
  confidence_trend: number;       // Improvement in average confidence
  coverage_completeness: number;  // Percentage of questions addressed
}

class ConvergenceAnalyzer {
  calculateStability(iterations: ExtractionIteration[]): StabilityMetrics {
    const recentIterations = iterations.slice(-3); // Last 3 iterations
    
    return {
      concept_variance: this.calculateConceptVariance(recentIterations),
      relationship_stability: this.calculateRelationshipStability(recentIterations),
      confidence_trend: this.calculateConfidenceTrend(recentIterations),

    };
  }
}
```

#### **Convergence Thresholds**
```typescript
interface ConvergenceCriteria {
  max_iterations: number;           // Maximum extraction runs (e.g., 15)
  min_iterations: number;           // Minimum runs before convergence check (e.g., 5)
  concept_stability_threshold: number;     // Concept variance < 0.1
  relationship_stability_threshold: number; // Relationship consistency > 0.85
  confidence_improvement_threshold: number; // Confidence trend < 0.05
  coverage_completeness_threshold: number;  // Question coverage > 0.9
}
```

### Quality Assessment Metrics

#### **Extraction Quality Score**
```typescript
interface QualityMetrics {
  conceptual_completeness: number;  // Concepts per question category
  semantic_coherence: number;      // Logical consistency score
  evidence_support: number;        // Text evidence strength
  ontological_validity: number;    // OWL/RDF validity
}

class QualityAssessor {
  assessExtractionQuality(ontology: ExtractedOntology): QualityMetrics {
    return {
      conceptual_completeness: this.assessConceptualCompleteness(ontology),
      semantic_coherence: this.assessSemanticCoherence(ontology),

    const analysisPrompt = this.buildQuestionGuidedPrompt(focusQuestions, iteration);
    
    // 2. Extract concepts with probabilistic assessment
    const concepts = await this.extractConceptsWithConfidence(document, analysisPrompt);
    
    // 3. Mine relationships with uncertainty quantification
    const relationships = await this.extractRelationshipsWithProbability(concepts, document);
    
    // 4. Assess extraction completeness against questions
    const completeness = this.assessQuestionCoverage(focusQuestions, concepts);
    
    return {
      iteration,
      concepts,
      relationships,
      completeness,
      confidence_metrics: this.calculateConfidenceMetrics(concepts, relationships)

    // 1. Aggregate concepts across extraction runs
    const consensusConcepts = await this.buildConceptConsensus(extractionResults);
    
    // 2. Calculate alignment probabilities
    const alignmentProbabilities = await this.calculateAlignmentProbabilities(
      consensusConcepts, 
      baseOntology
    );
    
    // 3. Resolve conflicts using statistical methods
    const resolvedConflicts = await this.resolveConflictsStatistically(
      alignmentProbabilities
    );
