   - Creates machine-readable ontological representations

2. **Semantic Integration & Harmonization** (8 minutes)
   - Automated alignment of extracted ontologies with base defense ontology
   - Conflict detection and resolution using semantic reasoning
   - Creation of unified knowledge model for integration

3. **Knowledge-Driven Pipeline Development** (8 minutes)
   - Code generation guided by semantic understanding
   - Validation rules based on ontological constraints
   - Interoperability testing with semantic verification

4. **Ontology-Aware Visualization** (5 minutes)
   - COP displays that understand data semantics
   - Interactive exploration of knowledge relationships
   - Compliance monitoring based on semantic constraints
