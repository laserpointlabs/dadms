Absolutely! Here’s a **detailed, actionable specification** you can give to VSCode Copilot (or any LLM code assistant) to start building the “AI Oversight/Monitoring Agent Layer” for your modular, tiered workflow system. The spec assumes you’re using Python/TypeScript backend microservices (REST, event-driven, or similar architecture), but you can easily adapt to your tech stack.

# AI Oversight/Monitoring Agent Layer – Implementation Specification

---

## **Overview**

Build an **AI Oversight Layer** that observes all major actions/events in the Prompt, Tool, and Agent Workflow services. Every event (storage, test, analysis, execution, error, etc.) is sent to one or more domain AI agents for review. The agents generate review logs, warnings, suggestions, or just “all clear” notes. All agent feedback is aggregated and exposed to users in a unified “AI Output/Problems” interface.

---

## **Components**

### 1. **Event Bus/Event Listeners**

* Capture all relevant domain events (CRUD, test, run, error) from Prompt, Tool, Workflow services.
* Each event payload includes:

  * Event type (`prompt_created`, `tool_registered`, `workflow_executed`, `test_failed`, etc.)
  * Associated entity data (prompt, tool, workflow, user, etc.)
  * Timestamp, actor, context.

### 2. **AI Agent Manager**

* Receives events from the event bus.
* Dispatches events to one or more domain agents, according to config/rules.
* Aggregates and stores agent responses.
* Can operate synchronously (blocking) or asynchronously (non-blocking).

### 3. **Domain AI Agents**

* Each agent is a module/class/microservice with a single responsibility:

  * E.g., Prompt Quality Agent, Workflow Health Agent, Tool Compliance Agent.
* Agents accept event+context as input and return a list of findings:

  * Each finding: `{level: info|suggestion|warning|error, message, entity_id, event_id, [suggested_action], [details]}`
* Agents can be implemented with OpenAI API, local LLMs, or custom logic.
* Agents should run fast; timeouts and error handling required.

### 4. **Review Log Storage**

* Store all agent findings/logs, indexed by event/entity/user.
* Should support efficient query/filtering (by date, entity, type, severity, resolved/unresolved, etc.)

### 5. **AI Output/Problems UI Component**

* Bottom panel or sidebar in the main UI (web or desktop).
* Real-time display of agent findings for current user/session.
* Supports filtering by severity, type, entity.
* Allows resolving, dismissing, or linking findings to user actions.

## **Data Structures**

```python
# Example: Event
{
  "event_id": "evt-20240709-00123",
  "event_type": "prompt_saved",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-09T12:45:00Z",
  "actor": "jdoe",
  "entity": {
    "type": "prompt",
    "id": "prompt-456",
    "version": 2,
    "data": { ... }
  },
  "context": {
    "workflow_id": "...",
    "test_id": "...",
    ...
  }
}

# Example: Agent Finding / Review Log
{
  "finding_id": "find-20240709-00456",
  "event_id": "evt-20240709-00123",
  "entity_type": "prompt",
  "entity_id": "prompt-456",
  "agent_name": "PromptQualityAgent",
  "level": "suggestion",  # info|suggestion|warning|error
  "message": "Prompt lacks test coverage for edge case: negative input.",
  "suggested_action": "Add test for negative input.",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "resolved": false
}
```

---

## **API Endpoints** *(REST Example)*

### **Review/Event Ingestion**

* `POST /ai-review/events`
  Accepts a new event, returns agent findings (async or sync).

  ```json
  {
    "event_type": "tool_registered",
    "entity": { ... },
    "context": { ... }
  }
  ```
* `GET /ai-review/findings?entity_id=&level=&resolved=`

### **Findings/Review Log**

* `GET /ai-review/findings?entity_id=prompt-456`
* `POST /ai-review/findings/{finding_id}/resolve`
* `GET /ai-review/findings?user=jdoe&since=2025-07-01`

### **Agent Config**

* `GET /ai-review/agents`
* `POST /ai-review/agents/{agent_id}/enable`
* `POST /ai-review/agents/{agent_id}/disable`

---

## **Agent Implementation Example** (Python Pseudocode)

```python
class PromptQualityAgent:
    def review(self, event):
        findings = []
        prompt = event["entity"]["data"]
        if "test_cases" not in prompt or len(prompt["test_cases"]) == 0:
            findings.append({
                "level": "warning",
                "message": "Prompt has no associated test cases.",
                "suggested_action": "Add at least one test case for validation."
            })
        if len(prompt["text"].split()) > 300:
            findings.append({
                "level": "suggestion",
                "message": "Prompt is very long; consider simplifying."
            })
        # ...call LLM API for advanced review...
        return findings
```

---

## **Event Pipeline Example (Step-by-Step)**

1. **User saves a prompt.**
2. **Prompt Service** emits `prompt_saved` event to the event bus.
3. **AI Agent Manager** receives the event.
4. **Agent Manager** sends event to all enabled agents (e.g., `PromptQualityAgent`, `BiasCheckerAgent`).
5. **Each agent** returns findings (suggestions, warnings, errors).
6. **Agent Manager** saves findings to Review Log.
7. **UI Output Panel** fetches and displays findings in real time.
8. **User** can resolve, dismiss, or act on findings. Actions logged for traceability.

---

## **UI/UX Specification**

* **Panel Location:** Bottom or side of app, always visible.
* **Displays:** List of current session/user findings, filterable.
* **Finding Card:** Shows icon (info, warning, error), message, agent, timestamp, \[action buttons].
* **Actions:** Click to view details, mark as resolved/dismissed, link to entity.
* **Aggregate:** Show summary (e.g., “3 warnings, 2 suggestions, 0 errors”).

---

## **Security and Performance**

* **Async Processing:** Agent reviews do not block core user actions (unless explicitly configured).
* **Access Control:** Only authorized users can view, resolve, or act on findings.
* **Privacy:** Sensitive data is masked or redacted from logs as needed.
* **Extensibility:** Agents can be added/removed/configured dynamically.

---

## **Sample Copilot Prompt**

> **You are implementing the AI Oversight Layer for a workflow system.**
>
> * Listen to all major events (CRUD, workflow run, tool registration, test execution).
> * For each event, send context to all enabled AI agent modules.
> * Each agent returns a set of findings (warnings, suggestions, errors, info).
> * Store all findings in a review log, indexed by event/entity/user.
> * Expose REST API to fetch, resolve, and manage findings.
> * Provide a UI panel for users to see and act on findings in real time.
> * Findings must not block workflow unless critical; log all agent advice for future audit.

---

## **How to Use with Copilot**

* Paste this spec into your repo as `OVERSIGHT_SPEC.md` or similar.
* Use the data structures and API contracts for your backend.
* Ask Copilot to generate Python/TypeScript event listeners, agent manager classes, REST endpoints, and minimal React/Vue/JS output panel component.
* Implement and test one agent first (e.g., prompt reviewer), then expand.

---

## **Optional: VSCode Task List**

* [ ] Set up event bus or hook for all storage/execution events.
* [ ] Implement Agent Manager (dispatch events, collect findings).
* [ ] Build at least one agent (prompt reviewer).
* [ ] Build Review Log (DB model, CRUD API).
* [ ] Expose findings via REST.
* [ ] Add Output/Problems panel to UI.
* [ ] Add ability to resolve/dismiss findings.
* [ ] Expand agent library (tool checker, workflow monitor, etc).
