# Modular Tiered Prompt-Agent-Tool Workflow System

**With Integrated AI Oversight/Monitoring Layer**
*(Version 1.0, 2025-07-09)*

---

## 1. **System Overview**

This system is a modular, API-first architecture for building, validating, and executing AI-driven workflows using LLM prompts and computational tools, with full oversight from domain-aware AI agents. It consists of:

* **Prompt Service** – Manages prompt templates, validation, test cases, and scoring.
* **Tool Service** – Registers and manages analysis tools (e.g., SysML, MATLAB, Scilab).
* **Agent Workflow Service** – Orchestrates execution of agent-driven workflows using BPMN.io process definitions.
* **BPMN Integration** – Visual workflow authoring and versioned process management.
* **AI Oversight Layer** – Domain AI agents observe, review, and annotate all actions and data flows, surfacing findings to users in real time.

All core services are decoupled and interact through RESTful APIs and a shared event bus for audit and review.

---

## 2. **Core Components and Capabilities**

### 2.1 **Prompt Service**

* **Prompt Management:** CRUD operations for prompts, versioning, tagging, search/filtering.
* **Test Case Support:** Associate prompts with test cases (input, expected output, scoring logic).
* **Prompt Types:** Simple, tool-aware (i.e., requiring tool context), workflow-aware.
* **Validation:** Run static, simulated, and live tool-based tests on prompts.
* **Scoring:** Human-in-the-loop, rule-based, and AI-assisted scoring for efficacy, alignment, coverage.
* **API:** RESTful endpoints for prompt, test case, and scorecard management.

### 2.2 **Tool Service**

* **Tool Registry:** Register, update, and manage tools with metadata, endpoints, health, version, and capability tags.
* **Invocation API:** Standardized interface for tool execution (sync/async); supports REST, script, or RPC integrations.
* **Health/Status Checks:** Automated checks and alerts.
* **API:** Endpoints for tool registration, lookup, invocation, and monitoring.

### 2.3 **Agent Workflow Service**

* **BPMN-Driven Orchestration:** Execute workflows defined in BPMN, mapping service tasks to prompt invocations, tool calls, or agent logic.
* **Workflow Versioning:** Manage multiple workflow definitions and versions.
* **Execution State:** Manage context and data flow between steps (inputs, outputs, tool responses, agent decisions).
* **API:** Endpoints for workflow definition, run, status, results, and logs.

### 2.4 **BPMN Integration**

* **Workflow Editor:** Web-based BPMN.io for graphical authoring.
* **Workflow Storage:** Store BPMN XML, associate with linked assets (prompts, tools, agents).
* **Annotations/Extensions:** Use BPMN extension elements to declare prompt/tool dependencies, agent requirements, and context bindings.
* **Export/Import:** Versioned workflow assets.

### 2.5 **AI Oversight/Monitoring Layer** *(integrated across all services)*

* **Event Capture:** Listens to all CRUD, execution, validation, and error events in Prompt, Tool, and Workflow services via event bus or direct hooks.
* **Agent Dispatch:** For each event, calls one or more domain AI agents for review and annotation.
* **Domain AI Agents:** Specialized in prompts, tools, workflows, compliance, coverage, or quality; review actions and provide findings (warnings, errors, suggestions, info).
* **Review Log Storage:** All agent findings attached to the relevant event/entity and stored for traceability.
* **User Interface:** Unified “AI Output/Problems” panel shows agent findings in real time to users, filterable and actionable (resolve, dismiss, details).

---

## 3. **Integration Points and Data Flow**

* **Event Bus:** All services emit events (e.g., prompt\_saved, tool\_registered, workflow\_executed, test\_failed) to a central event bus.
* **Oversight Hook:** AI Oversight Layer subscribes to events, analyzes with relevant domain agents, and logs findings.
* **API Callback:** When a user or system requests entity data (e.g., prompt details), associated review findings are fetched and displayed.
* **UI Component:** Every major UI section (Prompt Editor, Tool Registry, Workflow Runner) embeds the Output/Problems panel.

## 5. **APIs**

### 5.1 **Prompt Service**

* `GET /prompts/{id}` – get prompt (with findings)
* `POST /prompts/{id}/test` – run test suite (triggers event)
* `GET /prompts/{id}/findings` – list agent findings

## 6. **UI Requirements**

* **Output/Problems Panel:** Persistent panel (bottom or side) displays live agent findings relevant to the current view/entity.

  * Entries show icon (info/suggestion/warning/error), message, agent name, timestamp.
  * Clicking shows details and suggested actions.
  * Ability to mark as resolved, dismissed, or to link to further action.
  * Filtering by entity type, severity, agent.

* **Contextual Highlighting:** In editors or viewers (prompt, tool, workflow), unresolved findings are highlighted inline or summarized.

* **History & Audit:** Users can browse historical findings by entity, event, or agent.

---

## 7. **AI Agent Integration**

* **Agents as Microservices or Classes:** Each agent can be a Python/TypeScript module, REST microservice, or cloud function.
* **LLM-Enabled:** Agents can use local models or call OpenAI APIs for advanced reasoning, language review, code analysis, etc.
* **Domain Specialization:** Out-of-the-box agents include Prompt Quality, Prompt Coverage, Tool Compliance, Workflow Soundness, Security, Bias, Requirements Coverage.
* **Configurable:** System admin can enable/disable agents, set routing rules (which agents review which events/entities).

---

## 8. **Event Lifecycle & Oversight Flow**

1. **Action:** User performs an action (e.g., saves prompt, registers tool, runs workflow).
2. **Event:** Core service emits structured event (with context, entity, actor) to event bus.
3. **Oversight:** AI Oversight Layer receives event, dispatches to relevant agents.
4. **Review:** Each agent analyzes context, returns findings (with severity, message, suggestions).
5. **Storage:** Findings are attached to event/entity, stored for traceability.
6. **UI Update:** Output/Problems panel fetches findings for current context and displays.
7. **Resolution:** User or system can resolve/dismiss findings, actions logged for audit.

---

## 9. **Security, Performance, and Extensibility**

* **Async Processing:** Agent reviews do not block user workflow; agent responses can be displayed as soon as available.
* **Access Control:** All logs and agent feedback subject to RBAC policies.
* **Redaction/Privacy:** Sensitive content is masked in logs as required.
* **Hot-Swappable Agents:** Agents can be updated, added, or removed without system downtime.
* **Observability:** All events, agent reviews, and user actions are logged for future analytics and improvement.

2. **Phase 2:** Implement Tool Service with oversight hooks and ToolCompliance agent.
3. **Phase 3:** Integrate BPMN workflow execution with oversight of step-by-step execution.
4. **Phase 4:** Expand agent team (Coverage, Security, Human Factors, etc.), add advanced review features (batch review, historical trend analysis).
5. **Phase 5:** Full unified UI with real-time Output/Problems panel across all contexts, user-configurable agent settings, and audit tools.
