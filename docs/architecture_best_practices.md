# Architecture Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices for architecture design in the DADM project.

## Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Design Principles

Our implementation follows these key SOA principles:

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

### 2. Service Composability

Services are designed to be reusable and composable, allowing complex functionalities to be built by combining simpler services.

### 3. Loose Coupling

Services interact through well-defined interfaces with minimal dependencies, making the system more resilient to changes.

### 4. Abstraction

Services hide their internal implementation details, exposing only what's necessary through clean interfaces.

### 5. Reusability

Services are designed to be reused across different contexts and applications.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Registry

All services must be registered in the central `service_registry.py` which acts as a service locator pattern implementation.

### Error Handling

Each service should implement robust error handling and provide meaningful error messages to facilitate troubleshooting.

### Configuration

Services should load their configuration from dedicated configuration files in the `config` directory.

### Logging

All services should implement consistent logging using the Python logging module with appropriate log levels.

## Code Standards

### Branch Naming Conventions

* Use lowercase letters for consistency
* Separate words with hyphens (`-`) for readability
* Include relevant identifiers such as ticket numbers when applicable

### Branch Types and Prefixes

* `feature/`: New features or enhancements
* `bugfix/`: Non-critical bug fixes
* `hotfix/`: Critical fixes, often for production issues
* `release/`: Preparation for a new release
* `docs/`: Documentation updates
* `test/`: Experimental or testing purposes
