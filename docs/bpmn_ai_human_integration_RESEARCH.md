**Date:** June 19, 2025  
**Author:** Research Team  
**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This research investigates the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) modeling tools, specifically focusing on creating a conversational AI assistant that can generate, modify, and explain BPMN process models through natural language interactions. The proposed system combines React-based user interfaces with bpmn.io modeling library and LLM agents to enable real-time, collaborative process modeling.

The core innovation lies in bridging the gap between natural language process descriptions and formal BPMN XML representations, potentially democratizing process modeling by removing technical barriers for non-expert users while maintaining model integrity and compliance standards.

## 1. Background and Motivation

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the de facto standard for modeling business processes, but creating and maintaining BPMN diagrams requires specialized knowledge and significant time investment. Current modeling tools, while powerful, present barriers to adoption for non-technical stakeholders who understand business processes but struggle with formal modeling notation.

The emergence of sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an unprecedented opportunity to bridge this gap by enabling natural language interaction with modeling tools. This research explores the feasibility and implications of creating an AI assistant that can:

- Interpret conversational descriptions of business processes
- Generate valid BPMN XML structures from natural language
- Provide real-time explanations and suggestions
- Maintain model integrity and compliance standards
- Enable collaborative modeling between technical and non-technical users
