# Event-Driven Decision System (EDS): Concept, Architecture, and Development Strategy

## Executive Summary

The Event-Driven Decision System (EDS) is a next-generation decision architecture designed to continuously ingest real-world events, execute structured decision workflows, and emit tangible, trackable outcomes. Unlike traditional systems that culminate in static artifacts (e.g., white papers), EDS treats every decision as a bounded, actionable unit of transformation—triggered by an initiating event and resulting in a consequential event.

This white paper serves as a foundation for guiding LLM-based agents, software developers (via GitHub Copilot), and orchestrators (e.g., Cursor) in building and expanding EDS using intelligent, composable components, simulation workflows, and scoring mechanisms.

## Core Philosophy: The Punch Decision Process

EDS is grounded in a real-time, iterative framework inspired by a high-stakes human reflex scenario—the punch:

### Example: The ‘Punch’ Scenario

- **Event In**: Incoming punch (external event)
- **Objective**: Avoid injury (defined goal)
- **Assumptions**: Opponent is right-handed, expected angle, reaction time
- **Ontology**: Formalized knowledge of "punch," "avoidance," body mechanics
- **Data**: Direction, velocity, position, prior training history
- **Model**: Motion physics, body kinematics, evasive maneuvers
- **Parameterization**: Reflex delay, shoulder width, stance
- **Simulation**: Predict results of ducking, dodging, blocking
- **Validation**: Test historical reactions or real-world sparring outcomes
- **Analysis**: Assess maneuver outcomes vs objectives
- **Decision**: Dodge left
- **Event Out**: Action occurs, results registered (dodged, hit, countered)

Every decision in EDS follows this structure. It begins with a triggering event, proceeds through modeling, simulation, and analysis, and concludes with an emitted event—creating a closed, learnable loop.

## Foundational Pillars of EDS

### 1. **Event-to-Event Decision Flow**

Every decision is framed between two events:

- **Event In**: Data signal, change, or trigger
- **Workflow Execution**: Model-driven reasoning
- **Event Out**: Real action or consequence

### 2. **Knowledge & Heuristics:** **Ontology + Context Threading**

- Ontologies define structured decision spaces
- Context threads are stored in a vector database with metadata and feedback
- 'Context Threads' accumulate scores, revisions, and impact mappings

### 3. **Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis (MS&A)**

- Validated models: physics, ML, business, SysML
- Simulation tools: AFSIM, Simulink, Python engines
- Analytical evaluators define scorecards and options

### 4. **Agent-Oriented Execution**

- Agents are assigned tools, personas, and prompts
- Decision agents can bootstrap, simulate, and revise workflows (Decision Space)
- Supervisory agents monitor and score outputs

### 5. **Scoring Mechanism: The Baseball Analogy**

- **Batting Average**: % of successful decision executions
- **Clutch Score**: Impact-weighted score based on time sensitivity
- **On-Base %**: Utility of partial actions
- **Slugging %**: Combined impact x frequency
- Each decision, process, or agent earns scores over time

## Advanced Capabilities

### Event Decision Trees

- Automatically constructed decision chains
- Simulate all potential branches: event → decision → event
- Use game theory to evaluate complex, cascading impacts

### Event Decision Space Bootstrapping

- Generate "gray space" maps of possible outcomes
- Guide agent workflows or human review
- Enables proactive rather than reactive execution

### Terminal Events and Action Enforcement

- ***Every decision must produce an Event Out:*** Once the system is active, it runs continuously—forcing the evaluation and re-evaluation of the decision space in real time. Early on, this may seem manageable, as decision patterns converge and stabilize. But as new data, knowledge, and decision domains are introduced, the complexity and branching of the decision space will scale rapidly. This self-sustaining dynamic ensures that EDS remains not only responsive, but increasingly intelligent, adapting to a growing and evolving ecosystem of inputs and outcomes.
- Static reports (e.g., white papers) are insufficient unless they trigger downstream action
- Terminal decisions (e.g., mission end) must still be recorded as events for learning

## Application Domains

- Aircraft acquisition
- Options trading / market response
- Logistics planning
- ISR mission coordination
- Digital transformation initiatives

## MVP vs Vision

- **MVP**: Reactive execution of structured decision flows
- **Full Vision**: Autonomous propagation of self-learning decision graphs

## Implementation Notes

- Use GitHub Copilot to scaffold agents, pipelines, and test workflows
- Cursor can be employed to manage revisions, memory, and iterative design
- Workflows are executed serially but support parallel tree growth via agent branching

## Closing Statement

EDS is not just a decision tool. It is a continuous reasoning engine that builds and acts upon a living knowledge base. It replaces passive digital thread concepts with tangible execution. Every decision is scored. Every outcome is real. Every improvement is learned.
