### 1.2 Research Objectives

This research addresses the need for:
1. **Centralized Data Management**: Unified control over diverse data sources
2. **Model Management**: Integration of various modeling frameworks
3. **Simulation Management**: Orchestration of simulation workflows
4. **Analysis Management**: Comprehensive analysis lifecycle management
5. **Ontology-Driven Architecture**: Semantic knowledge and validation
6. **Decoupled Integration**: Maintainable, extensible tool integration

## 2. Ontology Management and Publishing

### 2.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is an Ontology?**
An ontology is a formal representation of knowledge that defines concepts, relationships, and rules within a specific domain. Think of it as a "smart dictionary" that not only defines terms but also understands how they relate to each other. For example, in a decision analysis context, an ontology would define what a "stakeholder" is, what "criteria" are, and how they relate to "alternatives" and "decisions."

**Why Ontology Management Matters**
In complex decision-making systems, different tools and users often use different terminology for the same concepts. An ontology provides a shared language that ensures everyone understands what they're working with. It acts as a "semantic glue" that connects different parts of the system, enabling automated validation, intelligent suggestions, and consistent data interpretation across all components.

**The Role of Publishing and Validation**
Ontologies need to be accessible to all system components while maintaining consistency and quality. Publishing an ontology means making it available through standardized interfaces (like SPARQL endpoints) so that any tool in the system can query it for validation, suggestions, or understanding. Validation ensures that the ontology remains accurate, complete, and useful as the system evolves.

### 2.2 Current State Analysis

The DADM system has nascent ontology capabilities:
- Basic semantic expansion in Neo4j
- JSON-to-graph mapping for decision components
- Limited ontology validation and governance

## 3. Data Management Architecture

### 3.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Data Management?**
Data management encompasses the processes, policies, and technologies used to collect, store, organize, maintain, and use data effectively. In the context of decision analysis, data management is about ensuring that the right data is available to the right tools at the right time, while maintaining data quality, security, and traceability.

**The Challenge of Multi-Source Data**
Modern decision analysis systems need to work with data from many different sources: databases, web services, human experts, real-time sensors, documents, and more. Each source has its own format, update frequency, quality characteristics, and access requirements. Effective data management means creating a unified view of all this data while respecting the unique characteristics of each source.

**Data Lifecycle and Governance**
Data has a lifecycle: it's created, processed, used, archived, and eventually deleted. Data governance ensures that this lifecycle is managed according to organizational policies, regulatory requirements, and best practices. This includes data quality monitoring, access control, lineage tracking, and compliance management.

### 3.2 Current Data Management State

DADM currently has:
- **Analysis Data Manager**: SQLite-based analysis storage
- **Data Persistence Manager**: Neo4j graph expansion
- **Vector Store Integration**: Qdrant semantic search
- **Basic Data Governance**: Policy-based data management

        pass
```

## 4. Model Management Architecture

### 4.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Model Management?**
Model management is the systematic approach to creating, storing, validating, executing, and maintaining computational models. In decision analysis, models are mathematical or computational representations of real-world systems that help us understand, predict, or optimize outcomes. These models can range from simple spreadsheets to complex simulations involving multiple disciplines.

**The Diversity of Modeling Frameworks**
Different domains and problems require different types of models. Engineers might use OpenMDAO for multidisciplinary optimization, systems engineers might use SysML for system modeling, and analysts might use MATLAB or Scilab for mathematical modeling. Model management provides a unified way to work with all these different frameworks while respecting their unique capabilities and requirements.

**Model-Data Integration**
Models need data to function, and they produce data as outputs. Effective model management ensures that models can easily access the data they need, that the data is in the right format, and that model outputs are properly stored and made available to other parts of the system. This creates a virtuous cycle where models inform decisions, and decisions inform model development.

### 4.2 Current Model Management

- **BPMN Models**: Camunda-based process models
- **Basic Model Validation**: XML schema validation

### 4.3 Enhanced Model Management

#### 4.3.1 Multi-Framework Model Integration

```python
class ModelFrameworkConnector:
    """Base class for model framework connectors"""
    
    def validate_model(self, model_file: str) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate model against framework requirements"""
        pass
    
    def execute_model(self, model_id: str, inputs: Dict) -> ModelResult:
        """Execute model with inputs"""
        pass
    
    def get_model_metadata(self, model_id: str) -> ModelMetadata:
        """Get model metadata and capabilities"""
        pass

    """MATLAB model connector"""
    pass
```

#### 4.3.2 Model Registry and Management

    id: str
    name: str
    framework: str
    model_file: str
    metadata: Dict
    inputs: List[ModelInput]

    def execute_model_with_data(self, model_id: str, data_ids: List[str]) -> ModelResult:
        """Execute model with specified data"""
        pass
```

## 5. Simulation Management Architecture

### 5.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Simulation Management?**
Simulation management is the orchestration of computational experiments that use models to explore scenarios, test hypotheses, or predict outcomes. Unlike simple model execution, simulations often involve multiple models working together, parameter sweeps, uncertainty analysis, and complex workflows that span multiple computational steps.

**The Role of Simulation in Decision Analysis**
Simulations allow decision-makers to explore "what-if" scenarios without the cost and risk of real-world experimentation. They can test different strategies, understand system behavior under various conditions, and quantify uncertainty in predictions. Effective simulation management ensures that these complex computational experiments are reproducible, well-documented, and efficiently executed.

**Simulation-Data-Model Integration**
Simulations typically require data from multiple sources, execute multiple models in sequence or parallel, and produce results that need to be analyzed and interpreted. Simulation management coordinates this entire process, ensuring that data flows correctly between components, that models execute in the right order, and that results are properly captured and made available for analysis.

### 5.2 Simulation Orchestration

**Simulation Workflow Management:**
```python
@dataclass
class SimulationWorkflow:
    id: str
    name: str
    models: List[str]
    data_sources: List[str]
    execution_plan: Dict
    parameters: Dict
    status: str
    results: Dict

class SimulationManager:
    def __init__(self, model_registry: ModelRegistry, data_registry: DataRegistry):
        self.model_registry = model_registry
        self.data_registry = data_registry
        self.active_simulations = {}
    
    def create_simulation(self, workflow: SimulationWorkflow) -> str:
        """Create new simulation workflow"""
        pass
    
    def execute_simulation(self, simulation_id: str) -> SimulationResult:
        """Execute simulation workflow"""
        pass
    
    def monitor_simulation(self, simulation_id: str) -> SimulationStatus:
        """Monitor simulation progress"""
        pass
    
    def get_simulation_results(self, simulation_id: str) -> SimulationResults:
        """Get simulation results"""
        pass
```

### 5.3 Simulation-Data-Model Integration

**Integrated Execution:**
```python
class IntegratedSimulationExecutor:
    def __init__(self, simulation_manager: SimulationManager):
        self.simulation_manager = simulation_manager
    
    def execute_integrated_simulation(self, 
                                    models: List[str], 
                                    data_sources: List[str],
                                    parameters: Dict) -> IntegratedResult:
        """Execute simulation with integrated data and models"""
        pass
    
    def validate_simulation_setup(self, 
                                models: List[str], 
                                data_sources: List[str]) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate simulation setup"""
        pass
```

## 6. Analysis Management Architecture

### 6.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Analysis Management?**
Analysis management is the systematic approach to planning, executing, monitoring, and interpreting analytical workflows. In decision analysis, this involves coordinating the entire process from data collection through model execution to result interpretation and decision support. It's about ensuring that analyses are well-designed, properly executed, and effectively communicated.

**The Analysis Lifecycle**
Every analysis follows a lifecycle: planning (what questions to answer), data preparation (what data is needed), execution (running models and simulations), interpretation (understanding results), and communication (sharing insights). Analysis management ensures that each phase is properly documented, validated, and connected to the next phase.

**Bi-directional Information Flow**
Analysis doesn't happen in isolation. Results from one analysis often inform the design of subsequent analyses. Models that perform well in one context might be adapted for another. Data that proves useful in one analysis might be prioritized for future collection. Analysis management captures these feedback loops and ensures that insights flow back into the system to improve future analyses.

### 6.2 Enhanced Analysis Management

**Analysis Lifecycle Management:**
```python
@dataclass
class AnalysisWorkflow:
    id: str
    name: str
    analysis_type: str
    data_sources: List[str]
    models: List[str]
    simulations: List[str]
    parameters: Dict
    status: str
    results: Dict
    metadata: Dict

class AnalysisManager:
    def __init__(self, 
                 data_registry: DataRegistry,
                 model_registry: ModelRegistry,
                 simulation_manager: SimulationManager):
        self.data_registry = data_registry
        self.model_registry = model_registry
        self.simulation_manager = simulation_manager
    
    def create_analysis(self, workflow: AnalysisWorkflow) -> str:
        """Create new analysis workflow"""
        pass
    
    def execute_analysis(self, analysis_id: str) -> AnalysisResult:
        """Execute analysis workflow"""
        pass
    
    def get_analysis_results(self, analysis_id: str) -> AnalysisResults:
        """Get analysis results"""
        pass
    
    def export_analysis(self, analysis_id: str, format: str) -> str:
        """Export analysis results"""
        pass
```

### 6.3 Bi-directional Information Flow

```python
class BiDirectionalIntegrationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.integration_hooks = {}
        self.event_bus = EventBus()
    
    def register_integration_hook(self, component: str, hook: Callable):
        """Register integration hook for component"""
        pass
    
    def notify_component(self, component: str, event: str, data: Dict):
        """Notify component of events"""
        pass
    
    def request_component_data(self, component: str, request: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Request data from component"""
        pass
```

## 7. ETL and Transformation Management

### 7.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is ETL and Transformation Management?**
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and transformation management is the process of moving data from source systems to target systems while cleaning, filtering, aggregating, and restructuring the data along the way. In the context of decision analysis, this involves taking raw data from various sources and converting it into formats that models and analysis tools can use effectively.

**The Role of Ontology-Driven Transformations**
Traditional ETL processes often rely on hard-coded rules for data transformation. Ontology-driven transformations use semantic knowledge to automatically determine how data should be transformed. For example, if the ontology knows that "customer_id" and "client_id" refer to the same concept, it can automatically map between these fields without manual configuration.

**Visual ETL Design**
Complex data transformations are often easier to design and understand when visualized as a flow diagram. Visual ETL tools like Node-RED allow users to drag and drop components to create data processing pipelines, making it easier to design, test, and maintain complex data transformations.

### 7.2 Node-RED Integration

**Visual ETL Pipeline:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml addition
node-red:
  image: nodered/node-red:latest
  ports:
    - "1880:1880"
  volumes:
    - ./node-red-data:/data
  environment:
    - NODE_RED_ENABLE_PROJECTS=true
```

**ETL Pipeline Management:**
```python
class ETLPipelineManager:
    def __init__(self, node_red_url: str):
        self.node_red_url = node_red_url
    
    def create_etl_pipeline(self, pipeline_config: Dict) -> str:
        """Create ETL pipeline in Node-RED"""
        pass
    
    def execute_etl_pipeline(self, pipeline_id: str, data: Dict) -> ETLResult:
        """Execute ETL pipeline"""
        pass
    
    def monitor_etl_pipeline(self, pipeline_id: str) -> ETLStatus:
        """Monitor ETL pipeline status"""
        pass
```

### 7.3 Ontology-Driven Transformations

**Semantic Transformation Engine:**
```python
class OntologyDrivenTransformer:
    def __init__(self, ontology_manager: SemanticKnowledgeManager):
        self.ontology_manager = ontology_manager
    
    def transform_data(self, source_data: Dict, target_schema: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Transform data based on ontology mappings"""
        pass
    
    def validate_transformation(self, transformation: Dict) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate transformation against ontology"""
        pass
```

## 8. Reporting and Dashboard Management

### 8.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Reporting and Dashboard Management?**
Reporting and dashboard management is the process of creating, distributing, and maintaining visual representations of data and analysis results. In decision analysis, this involves converting complex analytical results into clear, actionable insights that can be easily understood by decision-makers at all levels of the organization.

**The Role of Automated Reporting**
Manual report generation is time-consuming and error-prone. Automated reporting systems can generate reports on schedule, ensure consistency across reports, and adapt content based on the audience or context. This allows analysts to focus on interpretation and insight rather than report formatting.

**Interactive Dashboards**
Static reports provide a snapshot of information at a point in time. Interactive dashboards allow users to explore data, drill down into details, and ask "what-if" questions. This interactivity is particularly valuable in decision analysis, where understanding the sensitivity of results to different assumptions is crucial.

### 8.2 Apache Superset Integration

**Dashboard Management:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml addition
superset:
  image: apache/superset:latest
  ports:
    - "8088:8088"
  environment:
    - SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
  volumes:
    - ./superset-data:/app/superset_home
```

**Reporting Integration:**
```python
class ReportingManager:
    def __init__(self, superset_url: str):
        self.superset_url = superset_url
    
    def create_dashboard(self, dashboard_config: Dict) -> str:
        """Create dashboard in Superset"""
        pass
    
    def generate_report(self, report_config: Dict) -> Report:
        """Generate report from analysis data"""
        pass
    
    def schedule_report(self, report_id: str, schedule: str) -> str:
        """Schedule automated report generation"""
        pass
```

## 9. Scalability and HPC Management

### 9.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Scalability and HPC Management?**
Scalability and High-Performance Computing (HPC) management is about ensuring that computational resources can grow to meet increasing demands and that complex computations can be executed efficiently on powerful computing systems. In decision analysis, this involves managing computational workloads that might require multiple processors, large amounts of memory, or specialized hardware.

**The Challenge of Computational Scaling**
As decision analysis problems become more complex, the computational requirements grow exponentially. Simple models might run on a laptop, but complex simulations involving multiple models, parameter sweeps, and uncertainty analysis might require clusters of computers or specialized HPC systems. Effective management ensures that these resources are used efficiently and that users don't need to understand the underlying complexity.

**Worker Management and Load Balancing**
When multiple users or processes need computational resources, effective management ensures fair allocation, prevents resource conflicts, and maximizes overall system throughput. This involves queuing systems, load balancing, and intelligent scheduling that considers both user priorities and system efficiency.

### 9.2 Worker Management

**Distributed Processing:**
```python
class WorkerManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.workers = {}
        self.task_queue = Queue()
    
    def register_worker(self, worker_id: str, capabilities: List[str]):
        """Register worker with capabilities"""
        pass
    
    def distribute_task(self, task: Task) -> str:
        """Distribute task to appropriate worker"""
        pass
    
    def monitor_workers(self) -> WorkerStatus:
        """Monitor worker health and status"""
        pass
```

### 9.3 HPC Integration

**HPC Cluster Management:**
```python
class HPCManager:
    def __init__(self, cluster_config: Dict):
        self.cluster_config = cluster_config
    
    def submit_job(self, job_config: Dict) -> str:
        """Submit job to HPC cluster"""
        pass
    
    def monitor_job(self, job_id: str) -> JobStatus:
        """Monitor job status"""
        pass
    
    def get_job_results(self, job_id: str) -> JobResults:
        """Get job results"""
        pass
```

## 10. Event Management

### 10.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Event Management?**
Event management is the systematic approach to detecting, processing, and responding to system events. In the context of decision analysis, events might include data updates, model completions, simulation milestones, or user actions. Effective event management ensures that the system can respond appropriately to these events in real-time.

**Event-Driven Architecture**
Traditional systems often use polling or scheduled checks to determine when actions need to be taken. Event-driven architecture responds to events as they happen, making systems more responsive and efficient. For example, when new data arrives, the system can automatically trigger relevant analyses or update dashboards without waiting for a scheduled check.

**The Role of Event History**
Understanding what happened in a system is crucial for debugging, auditing, and improving system behavior. Event history provides a complete record of system activity, allowing users to trace the sequence of events that led to particular outcomes and identify patterns or anomalies in system behavior.

### 10.2 Event-Driven Architecture

**Event Bus Implementation:**
```python
class EventBus:
    def __init__(self):
        self.subscribers = {}
        self.event_history = []
    
    def publish_event(self, event_type: str, event_data: Dict):
        """Publish event to subscribers"""
        pass
    
    def subscribe(self, event_type: str, callback: Callable):
        """Subscribe to event type"""
        pass
    
    def get_event_history(self, event_type: str = None) -> List[Event]:
        """Get event history"""
        pass
```

### 10.3 Event-Driven Integration

**Component Event Integration:**
```python
class EventDrivenIntegration:
    def __init__(self, event_bus: EventBus):
        self.event_bus = event_bus
    
    def register_component_events(self, component: str, events: List[str]):
        """Register component events"""
        pass
    
    def handle_component_event(self, component: str, event: str, data: Dict):
        """Handle component events"""
        pass
```

## 11. Security Management

### 11.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Security Management?**
Security management is the comprehensive approach to protecting data, systems, and users from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. In decision analysis, this involves ensuring that sensitive data remains confidential, that only authorized users can access specific resources, and that all system activities are properly audited.

**The Multi-Layer Security Approach**
Effective security requires multiple layers of protection: network security, application security, data security, and user access control. Each layer provides defense in depth, ensuring that if one layer is compromised, others continue to provide protection. This is particularly important in decision analysis systems that might handle sensitive business or personal data.

**The Role of Audit and Compliance**
Security isn't just about preventing unauthorized access; it's also about being able to demonstrate that proper controls are in place. Audit trails and compliance reporting provide evidence that the system is being used appropriately and that security policies are being followed. This is crucial for regulatory compliance and internal governance.

### 11.2 Access Control

**Role-Based Access Control:**
```python
class SecurityManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.access_policies = {}
        self.user_roles = {}
    
    def check_access(self, user_id: str, resource: str, action: str) -> bool:
        """Check user access to resource"""
        pass
    
    def grant_access(self, user_id: str, resource: str, permissions: List[str]):
        """Grant access permissions"""
        pass
    
    def audit_access(self, user_id: str, resource: str, action: str):
        """Audit access attempts"""
        pass
```

### 11.3 Data Encryption

**Encryption Management:**
```python
class EncryptionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.encryption_keys = {}
    
    def encrypt_data(self, data: bytes, key_id: str) -> bytes:
        """Encrypt data"""
        pass
    
    def decrypt_data(self, encrypted_data: bytes, key_id: str) -> bytes:
        """Decrypt data"""
        pass
    
    def rotate_keys(self, key_id: str):
        """Rotate encryption keys"""
        pass
```

## 12. Uncertainty Quantification Management

### 12.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Uncertainty Quantification?**
Uncertainty quantification is the systematic approach to understanding, measuring, and communicating the uncertainty in computational models and their predictions. In decision analysis, this involves recognizing that models are simplifications of reality and that their predictions have inherent uncertainty due to data limitations, model assumptions, and computational approximations.

**The Importance of Uncertainty in Decision Making**
Decisions made without understanding uncertainty can be risky and potentially disastrous. Uncertainty quantification helps decision-makers understand the confidence they should have in model predictions, identify the most important sources of uncertainty, and make more informed decisions that account for the inherent limitations of their analysis.

**The Role of Dakota**
Dakota is a toolkit for optimization and uncertainty quantification that provides algorithms for sensitivity analysis, uncertainty propagation, and optimization under uncertainty. It can work with a wide variety of models and provides both local and global methods for understanding how uncertainty in inputs affects uncertainty in outputs.

### 12.2 Dakota Integration

**UQ Framework Integration:**
```python
class DakotaManager:
    def __init__(self, dakota_config: Dict):
        self.dakota_config = dakota_config
    
    def create_uq_study(self, study_config: Dict) -> str:
        """Create uncertainty quantification study"""
        pass
    
    def execute_uq_study(self, study_id: str) -> UQResults:
        """Execute UQ study"""
        pass
    
    def analyze_uncertainty(self, data: Dict) -> UncertaintyAnalysis:
        """Analyze uncertainty in data"""
        pass
```

## 13. Decision Points and Decision Management

### 13.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Decision Management?**
Decision management is the systematic approach to identifying, structuring, analyzing, and tracking decisions throughout an organization. In the context of decision analysis, this involves creating a framework for understanding what decisions need to be made, what information is needed to make them, and how the decision-making process should be structured.

**The Decision Point Concept**
A decision point is a specific moment in a process where a choice must be made. Each decision point has defined criteria, alternatives, stakeholders, and required information. By explicitly managing decision points, organizations can ensure that decisions are made consistently, with appropriate input, and with clear rationale.

**The Role of Decision Tracking**
Decisions don't happen in isolation; they build on each other and inform future decisions. Decision tracking ensures that the rationale behind decisions is captured, that the impact of decisions can be measured, and that lessons learned can be applied to future decision-making processes.

### 13.2 Decision Framework

**Decision Point Management:**
```python
@dataclass
class DecisionPoint:
    id: str
    name: str
    decision_type: str
    criteria: List[str]
    alternatives: List[str]
    stakeholders: List[str]
    data_sources: List[str]
    models: List[str]
    status: str
    decision: Optional[str]

class DecisionManager:
    def __init__(self, 
                 analysis_manager: AnalysisManager,
                 data_registry: DataRegistry):
        self.analysis_manager = analysis_manager
        self.data_registry = data_registry
    
    def create_decision_point(self, decision: DecisionPoint) -> str:
        """Create decision point"""
        pass
    
    def evaluate_decision(self, decision_id: str) -> DecisionResult:
        """Evaluate decision point"""
        pass
    
    def record_decision(self, decision_id: str, decision: str, rationale: str):
        """Record decision and rationale"""
        pass
```

## 14. Central Repository and Storage Architecture

### 14.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Central Repository and Storage Architecture?**
Central repository and storage architecture is the systematic approach to storing, organizing, and accessing all the data, models, simulations, and analysis results in a unified system. In decision analysis, this involves creating a "single source of truth" where all information is stored consistently and can be accessed by any authorized component of the system.

**The Challenge of Distributed Data**
In complex systems, data and information are often scattered across multiple systems, formats, and locations. A central repository provides a unified view of all this information, making it easier to find, access, and use data effectively. This is particularly important in decision analysis, where insights often come from combining information from multiple sources.

**The Role of Object Storage and Tuple Stores**
Different types of information require different storage approaches. Object storage (like MinIO) is ideal for large files, documents, and binary data. Tuple stores are better for structured data that needs to be queried efficiently. A well-designed storage architecture uses the right tool for each type of data while providing a unified interface for access.

### 14.2 MinIO Integration

**Object Storage Management:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml addition
minio:
  image: minio/minio:latest
  ports:
    - "9000:9000"
    - "9001:9001"
  environment:
    - MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin
    - MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin
  volumes:
    - ./minio-data:/data
  command: server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

**Storage Management:**
```python
class StorageManager:
    def __init__(self, minio_config: Dict):
        self.minio_client = MinioClient(minio_config)
    
    def store_object(self, bucket: str, object_name: str, data: bytes) -> str:
        """Store object in MinIO"""
        pass
    
    def retrieve_object(self, bucket: str, object_name: str) -> bytes:
        """Retrieve object from MinIO"""
        pass
    
    def list_objects(self, bucket: str, prefix: str = "") -> List[str]:
        """List objects in bucket"""
        pass
```

### 14.3 Tuple Store Integration

**Tuple Store Management:**
```python
class TupleStoreManager:
    def __init__(self, store_config: Dict):
        self.store_config = store_config
    
    def store_tuple(self, relation: str, tuple_data: Dict) -> str:
        """Store tuple in tuple store"""
        pass
    
    def query_tuples(self, query: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Query tuples from store"""
        pass
    
    def update_tuple(self, tuple_id: str, updates: Dict) -> bool:
        """Update tuple"""
        pass
```

## 15. Integration Architecture

### 15.1 Conceptual Foundation

**What is Integration Architecture?**
Integration architecture is the systematic approach to connecting different components, systems, and services so they can work together effectively. In decision analysis, this involves creating a cohesive system where data flows seamlessly between components, where models can access the data they need, and where analysis results can inform other parts of the system.

**The Service Mesh Concept**
A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that handles communication between services. It provides features like service discovery, load balancing, failure recovery, and observability without requiring changes to the services themselves. This is particularly valuable in complex systems where many services need to communicate with each other.

**The Role of API Gateway**
An API gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests to a system. It can handle authentication, rate limiting, request routing, and response aggregation. In decision analysis systems, this provides a unified interface for accessing all the different capabilities of the system while hiding the complexity of the underlying architecture.

### 15.2 Service Mesh Architecture

**Service Integration Pattern:**
```python
class ServiceMeshManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.services = {}
        self.routes = {}
    
    def register_service(self, service_name: str, service_config: Dict):
        """Register service in mesh"""
        pass
    
    def create_route(self, route_config: Dict) -> str:
        """Create service route"""
        pass
    
    def monitor_services(self) -> ServiceStatus:
        """Monitor service health"""
        pass
```

### 15.3 API Gateway

**Unified API Management:**
```python
class APIGateway:
    def __init__(self):
        self.endpoints = {}
        self.middleware = []
    
    def register_endpoint(self, path: str, handler: Callable):
        """Register API endpoint"""
        pass
    
    def add_middleware(self, middleware: Callable):
        """Add middleware to gateway"""
        pass
    
    def route_request(self, request: Request) -> Response:
        """Route request to appropriate handler"""
        pass
```
