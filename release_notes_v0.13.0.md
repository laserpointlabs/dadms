### ‚öôÔ∏è Revolutionary Property Management

#### Extension Properties System
- **Proper XML Structure**: Extension properties stored as `<bpmn:extensionElements>` following BPMN 2.0 standards
- **Custom Property Support**: Full support for user-defined properties with key-value pairs
- **Cache Performance**: Dual-layer caching (memory + localStorage) for optimal performance
- **Real-time Injection**: Properties immediately reflected in XML output

#### Implementation Properties
- **Service Task Support**: Complete `camunda:type`, `camunda:topic`, `camunda:expression` handling

- **Business Object Persistence**: Direct integration with BPMN.js business object model
- **Validation Integration**: Real-time validation with visual error feedback

### üöÄ Conditional Layout System

#### Route-Aware Styling
- **Page-Specific Layouts**: Different styling rules for BPMN workspace vs. management pages
- **React Router Integration**: Uses `useLocation` hook for intelligent route detection
- **Zero Interference**: BPMN workspace optimizations don't affect other application pages
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing pages maintain their original functionality

#### Responsive Design
- **Mobile Optimization**: Panels stack vertically on tablets and mobile devices
- **Breakpoint Management**: Intelligent adaptation to screen sizes (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- **Touch Friendly**: Larger touch targets and gesture support for mobile devices
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Layout and Spacing Issues
- **Black Areas Eliminated**: Removed unwanted black padding around BPMN workspace
- **Scroll Restoration**: Fixed lost vertical scrolling capability on management pages
- **Height Calculations**: Corrected workspace overflow extending below browser window
- **Panel Conflicts**: Resolved layout conflicts between different page types

### Property Persistence Problems
- **Session Reliability**: Extension properties now persist correctly across browser sessions
- **XML Synchronization**: Fixed cases where properties weren't reflected in XML output
- **Cache Invalidation**: Proper cache cleanup preventing stale data issues
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of localStorage failures and corruption

### BPMN.js Integration Issues
- **Context Pad Visibility**: Fixed invisible or hard-to-see BPMN.js context pad icons
- **Palette Styling**: Improved visibility of BPMN element palette
- **Event Handling**: Resolved event conflicts between React and BPMN.js
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper cleanup of BPMN.js instances and event listeners
