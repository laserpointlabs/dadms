- **Execution Time Tracking**: Added millisecond-precision execution time monitoring for performance analysis and system optimization

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Database and Performance Issues
- **Execution Time Display**: Fixed issue where execution times showed 0ms instead of actual latency measurements
- **Test Result Persistence**: Resolved problem where test results wouldn't persist between dialog sessions due to service state issues
- **Schema Compatibility**: Fixed database schema mismatches between timestamp and duration storage requirements

### Service Management
- **Directory Context**: Improved service restart procedures with proper directory context handling to prevent navigation issues
- **Service Lifecycle**: Enhanced service management with better state tracking and restart reliability
- **Terminal Command Handling**: Fixed terminal command execution with proper directory context preservation

### User Interface
- **Data Consistency**: Resolved test result display inconsistencies and improved data synchronization
- **Real-time Updates**: Fixed UI state management issues during test result operations
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling and user feedback during test management operations

## üìã Migration Guide

### From v0.13.2 to v0.13.3

#### Database Schema Updates
The database schema will be automatically updated to include new columns:
- `llm_response` (TEXT): Stores complete LLM response data
- `llm_provider` (VARCHAR(50)): Tracks LLM provider information
- `llm_model` (VARCHAR(100)): Records specific model used for testing
- `execution_time_ms` (INTEGER): Stores execution time in milliseconds

#### Service Restart Required
A service restart is required to apply the database schema changes:
```bash
# Stop services
cd /home/jdehart/dadm
./scripts/stop-all.sh

# Restart services
./scripts/start-all.sh
```

#### Configuration Changes
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing configurations remain compatible
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing test results will be preserved with default values for new columns
- **API Compatibility**: All existing API endpoints remain functional with enhanced response data

### New Features Available After Upgrade
- Individual test result deletion through the UI action buttons
- Enhanced test result display with complete LLM metadata
- Execution time monitoring in the test results interface
- Access to comprehensive documentation framework

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Enhancements
